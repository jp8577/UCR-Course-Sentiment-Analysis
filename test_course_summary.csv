AHS007,3.333," Prof. Endres, Fall 2023, takes attendance in person every lecture AND discussion. quizzes weekly that are due BEFORE CLASS . Midterm is just a long ass quiz, open note and take home, so its super easy plus he reuses questions from past quizzes on it ."
AHS008,2.5," Prof. Kotz was very unorganized, arrived 10-20 mins late to class, went on random spiels, and took a while to set up Canvas . Lectures were boring, repetitive, and I was always struggling to stay awake . Go to discussion if you want a good grade on your essays ."
AHS010S,4.0," Nicole Strathman is a very chill professor . No homework, gave out extra credit which was to go to a museum and answer the questions . She gives out pop quizzes which are short answer(about 3-4 questions) and midterm was short answer questions and a page front and back of multiple choice ."
AHS017A,7.0," This class is very reading heavy but not going to lie, my friend and I did not read a single thing for this class . Attendance is 20% of your grade but is only based on your discussion attendance and participation . There is an essay portion for both the midterm and final ."
AHS017B,6.5," Prof. Butz was the worst ever do not take with her!!!! Class consisted of 1 to 2 essays with one of them making us go to a museum, a midterm (80 mc, 1 short essay) and a final (mc/2 essay qs)"

AHS028,6.333," LeBlanc is a good prof and entertaining, gives 2 midterms and one final and an essay . Her exams are heavily memorization based so get ready to memorize 10+ images per week . Overall the class is difficult but not impossible if you put in work ."
AHS165,1.0, The final is an essay regarding various pieces of art . Easy quizzes based off asynchronous material in class . No discussion . Easy homework assignments .
AHS182,3.0, Not a good prof for this class. I did not learn much and she is extremely scatterbrained. She has never gotten back to many of our emails and her guidelines for assignments are very vague . She has not even graded anything and by the time I am writing this it is week 9 .
