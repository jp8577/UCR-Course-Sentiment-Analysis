AHS008,0.555," Prof. Kotz was very unorganized, arrived 10-20 mins late to class, went on random spiels, and took a while to set up Canvas . Lectures were boring, repetitive, and I was always struggling to stay awake . Go to discussion if you want a good grade on your essays ."
AHS010S,-0.57," Nicole Strathman is a very chill professor . No homework, gave out extra credit which was to go to a museum and answer the questions .

AHS028,0.033," LeBlanc is a good prof and entertaining, gives 2 midterms and one final and an essay . Her exams are heavily memorization based so get ready to memorize 10+ images per week . Overall the class is difficult but not impossible if you put in work ."
AHS165,0.872, The final is an essay regarding various pieces of art . Easy quizzes based off asynchronous material in class . No discussion . Easy homework assignments .
AHS182,-0.476, Not a good prof for this class. I did not learn much and she is extremely scatterbrained. She has never gotten back to many of our emails and her guidelines for assignments are very vague . She has not even graded anything and by the time I am writing this it is week 9 .
ANTH001,0.461," Prof. McMullin assigned 3 essays, with 1F and 1M . Attendance is done through PollEverywhere so show up to lecture . Dr. Nida would spend about 40 minutes of class doing poll everywhere's because he isn't very tech savvy ."
ANTH002,0.462," Took this class online with Dr. Berger and found it to be very easy . Had Maureen Hickey (Winter 2023), and as long as you put in the bare minimum effort for the class (attending lectures and doing all the homework) Attendance for lectures are required and recorded through a PollEverywhere ."
ANTH003,0.639," The class is split into the lecture portion, and the discussion portion . In discussion, you will research an archaeological site (Giza, Technotitlan, etc...) and write a group paper on the site, and an individual paper about one aspect of the site ."
ANTH005,0.497," The writing assignments and quizzes are super easy and should be an easy grade booster . The online reading quizzes were easy and directly pulled out of the textbook . The midterm and final require lots of memorizing, however, a fairly accurate study guide is given ."
ANTH007S,0.774, Took it Winter '22 with Prof. Hyejin Nah . Professor is super nice and accommodating! She accepted late work from students all quarter without docking points and even dropped the last assignment to give us more time with our finals .
ANTH020,-0.274," Isabelle Placentia is pretty nice but not the best lecturer . She believes there should be a discussion section for the class but there isn't, so she makes you do a lot of discussion type stuff to make up for it . One take home midterm and the final is a research project with a group ."
ANTH020S,0.86," The class is graded by attendence, attendence at discussion, a midterm, and a research project . The paper covered health and healing techniques used by certain groups of people (ex: Shamanism) This does not count for anthropology credit ."
ANTH100,0.527," Final exam (multiple choice, True-false, and essay questions) or writing up a thesis (15 page summary-argumentation essay) You can easily get by without the readings or videos, just familarize yourself with lecture slides . Hardest part of the class is if you try to keep up with all of the readings and videos ."
ANTH104,-0.519," There are two major projects in the class, each being a month long . The first gives the option between a cemetery anaysis and a monument burial analysis . The second project is a oseobiography ."

ANTH118,-0.169, Dr. Nawa Sugiyama squishes in so much information into one session . Take pictures of the slides instead of taking notes so you can pay attention to what she is saying .

ANTH115S,-0.296, Karl Ta
ANTH123,0.859, Just show up to class and turn it the assignments and it's an easy A . If you're doing a BCOE major this is a good one for DEPTH requirement if you happen to have a LING020

ARC072,-0.412," This class is easy, just show up, take notes, and listen . They require you to do homework but you should go for the online stuff instead of purchasing the book because it is"
ART001,0.774," This type of art class is very subjective and no one is ever told ""your drawing sucks"" I got an A in the class, but you shouldn't struggle to get an A whether you're an Art major or not . Your homework is 3 large drawings each week, and she gives you a theme for the drawings ."
ART002,0.945," Art is a subjective course so you can pretty much do whatever you want in this class . Every week there's a new theme (figure, landscape, still life) and you just need to paint things based on that theme . The materials can get really pricey but Gerald Sheffield was pretty lenient with whatever material you use ."
ART003,0.948," OMG EASIEST CLASS EVER WITH SARAH first day of class mandatory, it's soo easy . assignments were pretty simple ."
ART005,0.316," The class is about building sculptures with wood,metal,plaster, etc. It’s definitely a messy class, have clothes you don’t mind getting dirty . Only difficult due to the professor having poor management skills ."
ART006,0.606, You can probably get away with not doing anything for this class but you'll understand the material more if you actually attend class . Find a way to take it while the sun is up though cause walking back to the dorms from the Art Building is kind of scary .
ART010,0.0,No comments.
ART032,-0.807, The workload was way too much for an intro class designed for first years . The professor herself had poor time management and was rude to students . You will need to spend a lot of time outside of class to complete projects .
ART115,0.67," The class itself was good, but do not take it with Lisa Williamson . She has little regard for students and their visions and will railroad you into doing something she wants . Attendance policy is abysmal, you only get 1 absence per quarter ."
AST022,0.829," The class was really easy, you watch movies and like make comments bi-weekly, the discussion sections are kind of useless but you still have to go . There are two essays you have to do one for midterm and one final, personally"
BCH010,0.63," Everything is online, open note, open internet. There’s only two projects and overall he literally just wants you to listen and learn . The professor is really chill. If u get 85 or above, you get an A ."

BCH095,0.935," Pass/No Pass class that's super easy as long as you complete the online quizzes about each presentation posted online . Even though the overall class was boring, some of the presentations taught me about more opportunities to get involved in UCR and the community to help me build up my resume ."
BCH096,-0.194, Class was a rehash of BCH 95 but just with the paper . Mandatory for Biochem majors with medical emphasis . One paper
BCH100,0.704, There is a lot to memorize but if you keep with it it should not be a problem . The only reason i didn't give this a 10/10 for difficulty was the pass rate was 95% Taken with Paul Larsen .
BCH100A,0.039, Professor Dingwall is a wonderful professor with terrific cutoffs . Give yourself lots of time to study and prepare for each exam .
BCH110A,0.578, Biochemistry is a very difficult subject going into if you don’t put in the work for the class . Took this class with Dr. O’Leary and Dr. Blaha and both were really great professors . An A is definitely attainable and having them record their lectures and post them up on iLearn was useful when wanting to study for exams .
BCH110B,0.651," Dr. Dingwall is an amazing professor but don't fall behind on the lecture notes/material . Her and the TAs are very open to helping you, so don't hesitate to go to their office hours for help ."
BCH110C,0.802, The instructor is super dry but the class is early in the morning which lets you get it over with early . All of the slides are there with the information to memorize . Get the big concepts down and you'll be fine .
BCH184,0.0,No comments.
BIEN001,0.542," The class consists of pure lectures and talks from research professors and faculty from different branches of the bioengineering department . Only homework is a one page summary of each talk . No final, only presentation of senior design projects ."
BIEN010,0.646," Easy A. Just make something that works & present it (if it doesn't, do a proof of concept/analyze why it didn't work). Took it with Dr. Grover ."
BIEN101,0.026," Dr. Mckee typically teaches this. Exam avgs were super low and he gave us terrible 1 minute pop quizzes that everyone tanked . The ""projects"" were dumb"
BIEN105,0.501," One of the most universally loathed courses among bioengineers . The first two exams had a 25% and 40% average, and the final avg was 12% (TWELVE.)"
BIEN110,0.898, Dr. Park is always a good professor -- you can tell he genuinely enjoys teaching and cares about his students
BIEN111,0.434," Dr Kokkoni taught this class, it is new so not the best organization . She likes class participation and there is homework, exams and a group project . Stay on top of material and study what she focuses on ."
BIEN120,0.024, Dr. Christopoulos' has a thick greek accent and speaks at a mile a minute . Exams were awful with avgs in the ~50-60 range . There's a final and a final project involving a group term paper .
BIEN125,0.717," Weekly quizzes instead of tests, a project due at end of the quarter . Class covers some Biochem/Bio and focuses on genetic cloning ."
BIEN130,0.472," The lab portion of this class was very intensive . The reports were relatively long, but not harshly graded . The majority of the exam questions (multiple choice and free response) were on Canvas ."
BIEN135,0.267," Took with Palermo, grade was made up of 2 exams and a project . All the exam questions were from the textbook, which were gone over by the TA in disucssion . Project took 4 hours to complete ."
BIEN138,0.02," Took with McKee is a hell of a lot of memorization, on average each lecture has 50 slides and is densely packed with chemical and physiological information . Averages on quizzes/exams are chronically low due to the sheer volume of information ."
BIEN140A,0.587, Dr. McKee is one of the sweetest and most caring professors . The class is incredibly easy . I did not find any of the work very difficult .
BIEN140B,0.115, More challenging than 140A but only barely . Put effort
BIEN142,0.953," Not an easy A, but really fascinating material if you're interested in optics/biomedical imaging . Dr. Park gives you everything you need to succeed on the HW and exams as long as you focus"
BIEN155,0.307," The labs are easy enough, but unnecessarily time consuming due to waiting around for limited equipment . The lab reports are gnarly but necessary for"
BIEN167,0.728," All of my friends and I ended with a perfect score . Taken with Grover Fall 2022, it was an easy A considering Grover is the most considerate/thoughtful/nice prof in BIEN at UCR ."
BIEN175A,0.242, Senior design is what you make of it. Choose your group and project very CAREFULLY . Assignments were repetitive and time consuming. Most if not all skills acquired in senior design is self-taught .
BIEN175B,0.784," The brunt of this quarter for senior design is mainly the building of your device with your team, and programming it . There was an individual interview assigned at random on a weekly basis rotating through all the students to make sure you were doing equal work/not slacking ."
BIEN190,0.49," Undergraduate Research Symposium requires students to submit journal/apply+participate in a research event . No assignments, no exams, just deadlines running on UGR schedule ."
BIEN234,0.886, Material was engaging and incredibly fascinating . Exams were challenging and assessed genuine comprehension of the lectures . It was easy to put in substantial effort into this course because I woke up excited to attend .
BIOL002,0.891, Dr. Quinn McFrederick is hands down one of the best professors at UCR . Lucy Delaney was a really patient and kind professor . The midterm and finals are based on previous homeworks and quizzes .
BIOL003,0.006, Took it with Spasojevic/Regan . Pretty easy A if you studied for the exams and understood the labs . None of the labs took all three hours and weren't too hard . The exams were pretty straightforward but there is definitely a lot of information that needs memorization .
BIOL005A,0.44, Take Nothnagel/Martins-Green if you can . Read the book and go over posted powerpoints . Maslov is a good professor but martins green is pretty difficult and her lectures are hard to follow . Had it with sachs and martins-green .
BIOL05LA,0.131, The lab portion itself is easy . Quizzes are easy and short multiple choice questions . Lab exercise grades depend on pickiness of TA . Final sucked hard--it had material that wasn't learned in class .
BIOL005B,0.445, Hardest out of the BIOL 5 Series. Heavy memorization and less application based than 5A . Avoid Chappell at all costs. Avoid Chapell . Multiple choice for all test questions .
BIOL05LB,0.537, My TA was Sabbir Ahmed (spring 2020). He didn't answer any questions during the zoom labs which made it really hard to understand the worksheets especially as we couldn't do the lab in person . This lab is worth 25% of your final BIOL005B Lecture so do well!!
BIOL005C,0.372, Professor Ring Carde is a boomer when it comes to technology (he posted 3 hours videos because he forgot to stop the recording after the first hour) His videos were boring and the slides were poorly made (you would see text boxes all over the place) He was supposed to be giving out quizzes but completely ignored the syllabus .
BIOL020,0.516," One of the hardest classes I've taken at UCR...a lot of work for a 2 unit class . Equivalent to BIOL05LA, so you won't need to take this class . A lot of the material on the quizzes, midterms, and final were not discussed in class ."
BIOL030,0.525, Class is more for younger people that don't have much sexual education from classes and personal experience . TA made discussion an absolute chore to get through . Very little study required even for an A if you are good at memorizing facts/anatomy .
BIOL040,0.321," History of Infectious Diseases Took over the Summer with Eleana Guardado . All quiz and exam answers are from the slideshows she posts on iLearn . The material isn't super easy, but definitely not hard ."
BIOL102,0.3," David Nelson's lectures are useful, but it is very important to read the book in order to do well, as he takes a lot of concepts from the book for his exams . Don't take it wih Dr. Simon Groen's exams and lecture materials suck . Gachomo has much simpler concepts so she makes her midterm questions harder . Roose has much harder concepts to go over ."
BIOL105,-0.202," No homework is due, it’s hard to stay on track as all material is asynchronous . 95% of the midterms and final"
BIOL107A,0.133," Prof. Chen and Hailing Jin were a little difficult to understand (accents) Dr. Chen gives you possible things that will be covered on the final but not all of it will appear . Dr. Nagel's content was straight forward, if you watched the lecture, studied, and wrote notes, you will be fine ."
BIOL108,0.882, Great professor and good curve; Lots of calculations and research articles to read in
BIOL115,0.011," This was a fascinating class (Human Genetics), one of the most interesting I took as a Bio major . Maduro is the only one who teaches this class and wants you to know a lot of details . Maduro also makes it impossible to cheat, he keeps class attendance through quizzes and has different exam and homework versions ."
BIOL116,0.283, The class material is interesting if you like learning about conservation and biomes . There is also PollEv so you will have to go to class . The final felt easier than the midterms and had the highest average .
BIOL119,0.061," This class has been one of the worst classes I have taken at UCR . Professor Koenig is your typical unclear bad professor . The TA was horrible, could not speak English clearly at all ."
BIOL121,0.18, Second exam is the hardest so don't let your guard down . 100 pts extra credit available and a few % curve at the end . Roper is not very good at lecturing .
BIOL121L,0.898," The most tedious part of this course is having to attend lab twice a week . Professor Borneman taught this quarter . His exams are straight from his review slides, so if you memorize them you can easily get 100 ."
BIOL127,0.87, Took with Walton. Pretty dry with a lot of equations and charts for population dynamics . Formulas provided on exams which helps. Multiple choice exams and Simutext software assignments .
BIOL128,0.443," If this course is offered and is being taught by Raphael Zidovetski, DO NOT TAKE it . The class is graded only by: 35% midterm and 65% final . He does not curve and is very inaccessible . He will probably not answer your emails or answer your questions directly in office hours ."
BIOL155,-0.92, I took this course with professor Lukaszewski and he failed the entire class for the final . There is no direct grading scale or textbook for the class . The midterms were essays which we could revise but there was no guidelines or rubric . The final was based on 10 questions pulled out of a 40 questions study guide .
BIOL157,0.686, Prof Adler Dillman is one of the best professors in the biology department . The only problem with this class in my opinion is the research project that you have to analyze a research paper of your choice on a parasite you pick and dumb it down for 5th graders .
BIOL161A,0.827," Springer has easy questions, Reznick has hard questions: a + c, b + c ."
BIOL162,0.671, This class covers insect behavior and there are only 8 quizzes and no midterm or final exam . Professor Ysabel Giraldo is passionate about the topic and won't try to trick you .
BIOL163,0.852, This is by far one of the best biology upper divs UCR has to offer . Prof Clark is a really great lecturer and very accessible . Field trips every weekend takes up a lot of time and energy .
BIOL171A,0.624," This class had two professors, Natalie Holt and Wendy Saltzman . The midterm and final were online and open-note . Midterms included multiple choice and free response questions ."
BIOL171B,0.962," A bit harder than 171a IMO but more fun bc it focuses on muscles, digestion and renal instead of hormones . Take the lab if you can its not mandatory but it was super fun and made learning the material taught in class more understandable ."
BIOL174,0.912, All questions on the midterms and final came directly from the readings and lectures . There's a lot of memorization and he goes through info pretty quickly .
BIOL176,0.686," Fairly easy, basic math with physics concepts in a biological medium . Professor and TA are very passionate about what they teach . TA is a lenient grader for the midterm and final ."
BIOL178,0.841, Prof. Wendy is really nice and she is very understanding in these COVID times . Get a good TA that will definitely boost your grade at the end .
BLKS001,0.249," I took this class Fall 2024 with Joao Vargas . The class is a discussion type of class, It is very interesting . The grade is based on the quiz /group-facilitation/ attendance and final essay ."
BPSC011,0.368," Took Danelle Seymour. Laid back professor, lecture is a bit dry . Lecture recordings and slides are posted after every class . Only discussion has manditory attendance ."
BPSC021,0.932," It takes a lot of effort to study for the midterms which is a large chunk of your grade (25% for each three) because of the amount of content . If you start studying for each exam early via quizlet or your own flashcards, you are guaranteed a B ."
BPSC104,0.612," While the material is generally pretty simple for an Upper div bio class, there is a lot to memorize . The class is test heavy, with 2 midterms, 2 practicals, quiz every week, and a final . Do not take this for an easy A ."
BPSC132,0.74," Springer is a great professor, and curves the final grades . Not extremely difficult but also not an easy A . Study hard for the exams and lab"
BPSC143,0.852," Juan Pablo is an awesome professor, and the test and quizzes are very fair, just study the notes . The lab is a lot of work, but if you go the the TA for office hours they will help ."
BPSC150,0.97, Dr. Danelle Seymour is a decent lecturer who made the course enjoyable . She provided in-class questions that were instrumental in preparing for the quizzes and the final exam . She offers plenty of extra credit opportunities and is very kind .
BSWT001,0.238,  easy
BSWT002,-0.034, It's a S class so don't really have to worry about anything. But there are many assignments in comparison to the regular
BSWT003,0.121," The only downside of this class is the amount of materials you're required to buy . Don't bomb your essay cause those are like 75% of your grade . Focus on the feedback of the professor and use your essay as a standing point . Overall, and easy class since it's a S/NC ."
BUS010,0.302," The only hard thing about this class is the group project since you have to create your own product or service to sell and pretend you're a business . The first midterm was ridiculously hard (but there was an extremely generous curve), but the final was ridiculously easy ."
BUS020,-0.005, Samuelson is hard to keep up with sometimes . Barry Mishra steals lectures from other professors and does not care about students . The final is so hard that it is majorly curved . The professor was very bad at explaining things and then quit the class and passed it off to another man who did a better job .
BUS100W,0.772, Be prepared to do the most for this class just to get a passing grade . TAs can be a bit strict in grading essays so try to get feedback from them . Quizzes were given randomly and sometimes in the middle of lecture .
BUS101,0.65," No book needed for this class . Material is easy, but if you have no coding experience the latter half of the class might be difficult for you . Overall, a fun, easy class with a great professor ."
BUS102,0.266," The professor caps all of the grades on any assignment at a high B or a very low A, essentially ensuring that you will receive a B or B- in the class . The worst part of the class is that it's at 7:30 AM, so he knows that a lot of people aren't going to attend lecture . Overall the papers and discussions were easily A's ."
BUS103,0.362," The class itself isn't difficult, but Jasso gives a lot of work . The major assignments are four group projects and two exams . Try not to take this class during a quarter when you know you will be busy ."
BUS104,0.465," Professor is super boring but the homework and tests are not that bad . Homework usually had 4 to 7 questions and lectures were super boring because he reads off the slides . Quizzes are given in discussion every week, so definitely attend ."
BUS105,0.798," Took with Adem Orsdemir W21, fully asynchronous - 20-40min each lecture, released during official class time sharp . Attendance taken via simple quizzes on lecture material . He also lets you take your homework and exams with unlimited attempts ."
BUS106,0.028," Professor Peter Chung is so hard to understand and is an extremely harsh grader . If you do bad on the first midterm, the best grade you can get in the class is a C . This class was not hard at all, as long as you understand the formulas ."
BUS107,0.252," The prof posts lectures on iLearn but you should still go anyway . Discussion was useless imo but go for attendance . Quizzes were multiple choice and short answer, but were hard because the TAs were harsh graders ."
BUS108,0.068," The class is fine, the professor goes way too fast at times and the material progressively gets more complicated . You have to buy the course on WileyPlus and it's kinda expensive but it's mandatory ."
BUS109,0.621," Took with Raveendran online Spring 2021 . Super easy course, some busy work but insanely doable . Consider her as your professor as"
BUS110,0.34," The only way to fail this course is to literally not do your work . Took with Md, insanely easy course. Had a group project, 4 labs that included excel, tableau"
BUS111,0.849, I took this class with Nolan Fall 2023 and I would highly recommend it if you're looking for an easy elective . Attendance isn't mandatory either and there are no exams . You have a few individual papers which are based on lectures .
BUS112,-0.691, Only 1 midterm and 1final (40% & 60%) so if you are not a good tester then
BUS113,0.311," Ashutosh Prasad teaches sales & supply chain channels, but also teaches sales and supply chain ."
BUS114,0.648," If you have this class with jonathan lim, it is very easy. all you need to do is know the weekly content, fill out a google form answering questions on the content of that week and 3-4 group work that is based off if what is taught in class. no exams at all ."
BUS118,0.93," I took this class online with Professor Maciejovsky and it was a pretty easy course . Majority of the class is group work with 2 final projects . Overall, very easy content and easy workload ."

BUS123,0.854," Took this class online with Suri Gurumurthi . No midterm, 1 final, only met once a week despite having two lecture times . Homework was easy but worth very few points . Final exam requires a lot of excel work and is lengthy so study ."
BUS124,0.057," The class is very stats heavy, if you were able to pickup on Stat 8 you will be fine . Brush up on your stats knowledge in the first couple weeks and review course material before lecture . The homework assignments take time so start before the day its due ."
BUS125,0.68," This is an all Excel class and it teaches you how to use it in realistic situations with businesses . Material was complex, and the professor's lectures made it even harder . The professor walks you through the logic of the homework problems ."
BUS126,0.591," Took online with Gurumurthi. Class isnt too hard, had one large group project that I ended up doing on my own but still got a good grade . Highly recommend that you take this class AFTER having at least completed BUS 104 and BUS 105 ."
BUS127,0.922," Dr. Linda Penas is very nice and a pretty good instructor, though she has a tendency to just read off of her slides . Equations are WAY easier than in most statistics classes and you are allowed to make a ""cheat sheet"" for exams so you don't really have to memorize any . With two midterms and a project/presentation, the course does feel overwhelming ."
BUS128,0.975," The class wasn't that hard. It was mainly a memorization class with 3 total presentations . Make sure to have a good group because one of my group members was basically non-existent and tanked our presentation grade . Overall great class, very simple straight to the point ."
BUS130,0.71," Took this class with Professor Sohail she's easygoing, flexible, and makes lectures interesting . Heavy on memorization, you can get by if you just repeat her chapter quizzes on Canvas and practice lots . 3 group presentations online scholarly articles about the industry . Final was also 100 Question T/F optional based on the combined grade you received on your 3 midterms ."
BUS132,0.0,No comments.
BUS134,0.248, Mike Dong is a passionate and interactive professor . He incorporates current topics and news into his lectures . Overall the class was straightforward .
BUS136,0.281," The content of the class itself is not that hard, but for me the professor sucked . She tends to go off topic, so you don't really know what is most important . Greg Richey is one of the coolest finance professors at UCR ."
BUS143,0.87," The professor is great, he makes every topic interesting and has a lot of opportunities for extra credit throughout the quarter . There's no midterm and only a final - the final is about a case study with 6 questions and all he tells you is that you have to use class concepts for it . The class isn't hard at all if you spend time doing the readings and listen in class ."
BUS145,0.87, The class is activity and group project based so be prepared to engage in class . The main focus is a group project which requires you to work with an external company . This is a great class to build soft skills .
BUS146,0.902," This class with Haibo Liu is a really fun class about entrepreneurship . It mainly consist of a midterm presentation, a final presentation, and a take home final ."
BUS149,0.904, Took this class with Maciejovsky . Probably the most interesting material in any business course . Easy weekly assignments that take <5 mins. Highly recommend .
BUS152,0.677, The class is really not that difficult if you do the extra practice problems and skim through the textbook to gain a better understanding of the concepts . Do well on homework and extra practice quizzes because some of the questions are the same as the exam questions .
BUS154,-0.472, 30% of your grade is a group project and presentation in a pandemic . The prof also has attendance and participation as about 25% of the grade .
BUS155,-0.114, Fall 2020 (online b/c Covid); Raj Sign taught this . If you have Raj as a professor (like in 107) then you will know the format . You can buy the book but tbh I'm not sure it's beneficial to learning .
BUS157,-0.114, Fall 2020 (online b/c Covid); Raj Sign taught this . If you have Raj as a professor (like in 107) then you will know the format . You can buy the book but tbh I'm not sure it's beneficial to learning .
BUS165A,0.664," If you want to pursue accounting, this class requires you to attend EVERY SINGLE LECTURE . Attendance is mandated and points are deducted for every lecture missed . This is a class where if you don't put in work, you will fail ."
BUS165B,0.0,No comments.
BUS168A,0.849," Winter 2022 Class was doable, easier compared to 168B, took it with Eric Allen . Tests were free response so there are a lot of possible partial credit points . Grading consisted of 2 exams, discussion during lecture, discussion, and group project ."
BUS168B,-0.318," Spring 2022 was significantly harder than 168A in my opinion . 2 exams online, homework online, end of term project - had to fill out tax return . Pittard is a good lecturer but the topic in general is just difficult ."
BUS171,0.625, Kan was a great guy. He recorded all lectures and only required 2-3 in Zoom sessions . Homework assignments were very reasonable .
BUS172,0.572," Took with Silvu and all his midterm, final, and quiz answer were A. figured this out on the first 2-3 quizzes and stopped going to class because he just kept forgetting to shuffle the questions ."
BUS173,0.792," The class is mainly asynchronous with 2 live sessions - one on the first day and another around week 3 . There are about 4 homework assignments spread out evenly, so make sure to start a little earlier . The last homework is always a small research paper ."
BUS174,0.44," Only a few homework assignments, midterm, and group project relatively easy ."
BUS175,-0.078," Took with Underhill, insanely easy professor that accomodates and understands his students . Just do the work, most of it is guided and not hard at all . The only reason you fail is because you decided to do all your work the day it was due ."
BUS179,0.895, Rich Yueh is an amazing teacher to have . Offers good insight and is very kind/caring . Class grading structure was easy and the ARCGIS platform was interesting to learn .
CAH001,0.717," An extremely easy class, homework takes on average a couple seconds to a couple minutes . introductory class about the cahuilla"
CBNS101,0.492, The final was harder than the material from the first two midterms though . Don't expect a huge curve since averages on midterms were 77-80% . Vijayalakshmi Santhakumar was a great professor .
CBNS106,0.599," No homework, but there is a lot of material to go over, especially post midterm . Make sure you are on top of all the material, because it’s honestly too much to cram right before the exam ."
CBNS116,0.662, I took it with professor Dr. Fiacco and he was incredible! Provides lecture notes himself . Study often and when you do actually write out the terminology/area/function because it helps with fill in the blank exams/quizzes .
CBNS120,0.838," Class is lecture heavy, mostly memorization especially the second half . Michael Adams is a great professor for this class and only teaches the most important things in NURO . Dr. Fiacco has well prepared slides and lecture notes, very helpful for studying ."
CBNS120L,0.647," Michael Adams is very lenient when it comes to extensions . Nice man, but very monotoned . Lab reports were heavy (20-30 pages) and graded harshly by TAs ."
CBNS121,0.184," Took this class with Martin Riccomango and he has a very heavy accent . Tests in person were difficult, but manageable if you watch lectures/attend meetings ."
CBNS124,0.167," Professor Curras requires both yuja and a lockdown browser . Exams are based on mainly the slides and research papers . She provides lots of extra credit opportunities, up to 20 pts!"
CBNS125,-0.34, Took it with Dr. Hickmott and his tests were pretty difficult . His TA Sarah was terrible. You had to know everything
CBNS128,0.909, Took it over the summer with Professor Kurt Spurgin and it was pretty easy going . Questions are straight from notes/slides . Dont need a book and no discussion so that was great .
CBNS150,-0.152," A+ lecturer, but the multiple choice on the exams will leave you praying to any and all gods you can think of . First half will be easy, but second half the information becomes a lot more difficult . MT2 was extremely difficult ."
CBNS165,0.915," Took this with Dr. zur Neiden over the winter . The topic was very interesting, and the material wasn’t too difficult"
CEE010,0.318," There's 4 very short essays to write, and by short, I mean like a little over half a page . No exams or other assignments but attendance is mandatory . Just had to listen to guest lecturers once per week, only 4 one page assignments ."
CEE135,0.672, Concepts are fairly easy to understand. Just review the slides every so often . Beware of the final paper and presentation and try to work on it asap . Pick a topic not too complex or that at least one group member understands well .
CEE158,0.829, Make sure to take good notes because quizzes are open note and very
CHE100,0.628," Thermodynamics is a pretty wack class but just trust that it'll be okay . Cheat sheet allowed on exams, midterm wasn't particularly hard . Overall, okay class if you know how ideal and real gases work and understand engines well ."
CHE105,0.945, Took with Professor Kandis Leslie Abdul-Aziz . Shes a very sweet and understanding professor . Simple quizzes once a week to make sure you keep up with the content .
CHE110A,0.0,No comments.
CHE110B,-0.743, Suggested problems (no homework) were difficult . Know how to read your graphs (they get real weird looking) This course is big on balances (mass and energy)
CHE114,0.248, If you get on the professor Min's good side you will be fine . Asking for help makes this class 200% easier . She will curve the tests if people do really bad and give second chances if you mess up .
CHE116,0.0,No comments.
CHE120,-0.274, Dr. Clark is super difficult and incredibly rude . Does not accept late work whatsoever and purposefully makes the tests very difficult . Expect to spend several hours per question on the hw assignments .

CHE130,-0.784," For Dr. Wu, exams are open note. Abuse the hell out"
CHE135,0.919," The class is pretty easy and honestly interesting if you are half interested in material science as a chem/env e.  Group Project is pretty hard, since it's a research paper on a material ."
CHE160A,0.0,No comments.
CHEM001A,0.37, Fokwa (fall 2024) was pretty engaging but this class took up most of my time . Content is similar to AP Chem . Do not take with BARTELS .
CHEM01LA,0.498," Always come to class with the previous weeks lab report and conclusion(unless it was already turned in) and this week's lab procedure and prelab . For lab quizzes, just make sure to know the procedure and some background info from the lab you are doing that week and the week before that and you should be fine! Don't sweat about doing poorly on the final, which is generally the average . Dr. David Hill was a harsh grader compared to the other TAs, but the final and class was curved at the end ."
CHEM001B,0.629," Dr. Eichler's grading policy is amazing and he gives out a lot of extra credit . Reading the textbook is extremely helpful and he bases most of his exam questions off of what he teaches on slides . The exams are all closed book and proctored . Clicker questions (20%), discussion points (10%), and homework (20%) make up 50% of the grade ."
CHEM01LB,0.705," The final was hard for the fact it was mostly calculation questions, so look over all your quizzes again and the practice final . The lab is far more hands on than in CHEM01LA, so you gotta be on top and try to not mess up on your results ."
CHEM001C,0.162," Dr. Jiang is great, clickers and practice exams similar to actual exam . Ming Lee Tang's class is really a tossup, but her exams were difficult . Polleverywhere questions are based on the materials and lecture vids ."
CHEM01LC,0.164," The lab manual is HORRIBLE at explaining how to do calculations . Vague instructions on calculations, and you better hope you have a good TA . The labs manuals are already poorly written from when you take 1LA . This lab is far more difficult from solely the quizzes ."
CHEM005,0.259," Content and labs are similar to genchem, but the labs emphasize precision and accuracy . Difficulty depends on the TA and when you take it . Some TAs require 5-ish page lab reports for every experiment ."
CHEM008A,0.526, Ochem is hard and definitely do not slack off! Stay on top of your studies and even get ahead so you can be more prepared . Cramping simply does not work for this class .
CHEM08LA,0.58," The lab itself is kinda fun but the post labs can be extremely hard . Invest in a chegg account and you will be ok . Final is pure memorization, you are given 80 questions to remember and 24 will be picked out to be used in the exam ."
CHEM008B,0.287," Kevin Kou is the best OCHEM professor I've ever had . He gives out free-response exams, which don’t really make sense and for a class like organic chemistry, it makes learning the material for the class even harder . Teaches unnecessary stuff as well from the textbook such as molecular orbitals ."
CHEM08LB,0.566," The early labs in the quarter are the hardest while the later part are the easiest . There will be chances where you might not be able to finish the lab, or have experimental errors ."
CHEM008C,0.657, First two chapters are probably the hardest of the entire class . After CH 18/19 the rest of the class is biochem focused and generally the material is easier to understand . Curve is generous but you need to excel to get the A .
CHEM08LC,-0.067, The lab manual itself had a ton of typos and alot of the information was straight up wrong or came with some caveat . The entire lab is figuring out NMR charts that are incredibly complicated and not intuitive at all . The final is also super scary and some questions were insane .
CHEM109,0.489," The material is confusing and unintuitive and ranges from thermodynamics to quantum chemistry . Getting an A is difficult, but not impossible, so long as you're willing to put more work in than usual . Dr. Debus gives homework that is (mostly) representative of his exams barring any conceptual questions ."
CHEM110A,0.161," You can score 100% on the exama if you do ALL evens on the back of the chapters . Kawai Tam uses chapter problems as the problems in her midterms/finals . The actual calculations are of little consequence . If you study regularly, you'll do fine ."
CHEM110B,0.272, Class is sometimes needlessly complicated because the prof micromanages everything from student time to ta discussions . If you work well on cheat sheets the exams are *doable* though far too long . Averages on exam were around 50-60% .
CHEM111,0.393, Lab reports weren't too bad but definitely go to the TAs' office hours if you're having trouble . Majority of your grade is based off of the labs . Final exam was multiple choice and open note/open book .
CHEM125W,0.278," A lot of information, but you're allowed to have cheat sheets on midterms and final . Expect to type up 3-5 pages for lab reports . Will also be using excel a lot for making calibration curves and tabulating data ."
CHEM150A,0.859, Beginning of the class was easy but gets tougher once you get to symmetry . Really important to understand symmetry as it relates to all material .
CHFY007,0.69," DO NOT BUY the textbook! In fact, you shouldn't get it in any form, as all of the ideas in it appear in a much better structure in What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20 ."
CHN004,-0.695," A given week may include a presentation, 1-2 quizzes, and a midterm . The final assignments start around Week 9, with 3 parts: A Q&A portion with the professor (the first part), a recorded skit (recorded during Week 9 or 10 depending on your group) and a traditional exam during finals week ."
CHN020A,0.765, Winter 2021: completely depends on how comfortable you already are with mandarin tbh .
CHN020B,0.881, Lots of memorization as that is what Chinese is . Decently easy A unless mandarin is not your
CHN030,0.98, Overall passionate about the class and friendly (arranged a study session to help us out) but quizzes are extremely hard (eight in total) with low averages . Getting a higher quiz score is possible but READ the texts which is actually a ton of reading and attend all lectures .
CHN046,0.777," The readings/movies are basically the whole class . There's no midterm or final exam, just a series of quizzes and tests that are really easy . Prof Wu is a really easy grader and is nice but is sometimes hard to understand ."
CHN101A,0.987," There are almost daily quizzes for vocab but are really easy . Be prepared for a lot of homework though, but honestly it really helps if you want to retain what you learned . Attendance is definitely mandatory ."
CHN132,0.426," Do the reading, and do it before class (as instructed) It doesn't matter if you don't understand what's going on . At least you won't be hearing about it for the first time in class ."
CLA010A,0.851," These entire Classics 10 sequence is usually taught by Raschke . She might seem intimidating at first, but don't let her scare you . As long as you go to class and actually pay attention, you'll be just fine ."
CLA010B,0.806," These entire Classics 10 sequence is usually taught by Raschke . As long as you go to class and actually pay attention, you'll be just fine . Discussions are worth 15% of your grade but theres no assignments just make sure you participate ."
CLA010C,0.759," These entire Classics 10 sequence is usually taught by Raschke . There is a lot of readings, but you don't really need it to do well in the class . The professor is definitely an interesting and exciting professor, and you can really understand the enthusiasm he has on the topic of Roman history ."
CLA012C,0.0," Took with christopher simons, 3 essay topics given throughout the quarter, you need to pick 2 to write an essay on . Attendance taken at beginning of class through T"
CLA017,0.49, Pop Quizzes -10% of grade and 10% of final grade . Final grade 35% Of grade made up of 15 mc non cumulative questions and 2 (4 page) cumulative essays done in person and closed book  -SUPER HARD .
CLA020,0.987, The homework wasn’t graded on accuracy! You’d get full credit just for turning it in on time . 10/10 class will take any class with this professor honestly!!!
CLA040,0.85," Benjamin King records and uploads lectures onto Canvas and requires online quizzes after each lecture . There is a lot of assigned reading but you can still pass with an easy A without ever reading it . There's two essays, and the midterm and final are multiple-choice ."
CLA112,0.163," This class requires you do the readings before class, or you will lose points on quizzes . The nice thing about this class is that there is no discussion or lab . The final was due before finals week, which freed up a lot of time ."
CPLT002,0.0," Professor Sottong goes wayyy to fast in lecture and assigns way too much readings . If you're taking it for a breadth class, don't ."
CPLT017A,0.0, Specifics of reading will be asked and discussion is 20%
CPLT017C,0.945," Took the class online with Dr. Kalu as the professor . There was a lot of reading, and the lectures were a bit unorganized . However there was only a midterm, one research paper, and a final ."
CPLT023,0.962," Dr. Anne McKnight is super nice and doesn't try to make things hard or complicated for you . Mild importance placed on knowing Japanese names, which I'm bad at, and certain literary concepts . The class is heavily based on analysis of Japanese modern literature like haiku, tanka, and other Japanese literatures ."
CPLT025,0.792," There's only three assignments and three tests, but you won't actually learn anything about science fiction . The assignments were journals on each of the stories read in class . The tests are easy enough because they're all multiple choice or true/false ."
CPLT040,-0.153, Weekly quizzes are less about the facts of the readings and more about your opinion about general questions . The content is very jarring and trigger warnings are NOT included . One midterm and final that are just a longer version of the weekly quizzes .
CPLT062,0.926," Minh Nguyen Fall2020: 9 Discussion assignments, 1 Essay, 1 Final . Optional zoom meetings and they count as extra credit if you participate . Class is about South East Asian literature ."
CPLT070,0.425," If I could recommend you not to take it, I would . Unnecessary amounts of reading, and a ridiculous amount of work assigned a week . Heavy course assignments for a breadth course ."
CPLT110,0.84," Professor John Kim does one 250 word precis a week, one midterm, and one final, all online . For the midterm and final, you can just copy paste your precis . I never even read any of the material and got an A ."
CRWT045,0.914, The only way this class will be difficult is if you lack creativity . EASIEST BREADTH EVER! took with professor rachelle cruz .
CRWT046S,0.802," Winer’s a fun professor, pretty easy, just a lot of reading (~200-500pg book per week, every week) Hardina is a very funny and chill professor . Lectures aren't mandatory and they are pretty boring ."
CRWT047S,0.918," Sara Borjas is a young professor and full of energy yet understands so she gives us 1 free mental health wk. Every 2 wks you type 2 poems & final was optional for us. Great class, live famous poet sessions a few times ."
CRWT056,0.533," A lot of writing, but a lot of this writing doesn't take that long, so I think it was OK . One of the easier Fine Arts classes if I had to guess . There were weekly journals based on a portion of the readings ."
CRWT057C,0.852," There’s only one piece that you need to write over the course of the quarter . The class itself is more of a workshop, you spend 90% of the time in class critiquing other people's pieces ."
CS005,0.519, The subject is confusing because the professors and T.A'S aren't good . Professor Yifei Ding is really good at explaining it and makes it as easy as possible . The labs are based off of YouTube videos they give you to copy off of so you're literally given an A for your lab assignment .
CS006,0.276, The only tests that you have are just MC quizzes based off the lecture material . AVOID Professor Montazeri . She was disorganized and passive aggressive towards the class .
CS008,0.453," Just go to class on review days before the exam, easy A with Toby G. Just make sure you take it with a professor named Toby Gustafson . The material itself is not difficult, but the midterms are difficult ."
CS009A,-0.14," Took in Spring 2024 with Westin Montano . Please get him if possible, he made the class very fair and is overall a fun and great teacher . Go to class every day, read the zybooks or textbook that they give you and practice problems along with them . DO NOT CHEAT or use chatgpt to write your code ."
CS009B,0.881," The actual content was not that hard - especially if you already know a little bit about python . The labs are the hardest part about the course, but taking some time to truly focus on them should make it very doable ."
CS009C,0.966," This was the first time the class was being offered, so it's likely there will be changes in the future . Attending lectures and labs was necessary as not attending any would bring your grade down an entire letter . Paea LePendu was a good instructor that was pretty open to making any changes that could make the class easier ."
CS010A,0.558," The class counts as a weeder course although it is the first introduction to coding you will see in your life . Avoid professor Rusich, Ryan at all cost . Make sure to do all labs, programming and challenge activities as it's just free points ."
CS010V,0.484," As long as you are focused to do the work, lab and class are the same . Try to get Vahid, him and Joe make this experience amazing ."
CS010B,0.569," CS12 is a relatively difficult class if you don't study the material and actually understand it . Pointers and linked lists were the most emphasized topics, but it was easy enough to visualize and grasp with enough concepts . If you're coming from AP Computer Science A, you're in great hands ."
CS013,-0.051," Class is difficult but not impossible to pass . Completing all readings thoroughly should be enough to understand concepts . In order to learn the actual syntax you should attend office hours, Google search code and maybe watch a couple of YouTube videos ."
CS010C,0.204," One of the most challenging lower division CS classes . Harder than CS12, but manageable . Avoid Mart Molle if you don't feel like you have a solid foundation in CS10-12 ."
CS061,0.31," First half of class is extremely easy overall, but it does get more challenging afterwards . Quizzes should now be done in groups, and Linard let us use notes and textbook when we did them . Homework is ok, just at least attempt you'll get 100 . Midterm was decently hard, but again similar to previous quarters midterm ."
CS100,0.361," If you don't have a solid CS10-CS14 foundation, this class will be harder . The labs are easy but assignments are killer . The only hard part of this course is the project . Took it with Reem Ali Fall 2023 ."
CS105,-0.083," Professor Strzheletska is one of the most incompetent professors in the UC Riverside CS department . The class itself is not that difficult, but just do not take it with her ."
CS108,0.778, First time this class has ever been offered . Easiest computer science technical elective i've ever taken . Write a one page report (single spaced) five times for each special presenter .
CS110,0.842, Introduction to Web Development is in the real world where technologies are quick to rise and quick to die meaning that there are a multitude of concepts and stacks to learn . Avoid this class at all cost if you have no experience in web development .
CS111,0.166," The format of this class absolutely destroys you with quizzes and homework, plus the final destroys everyone . Do well on quizzes (80% or higher, if possible) Do not waste time procrastinating on homework . Avoid Yugishari Shashwat at all costs ."
CS122A,0.861, Took it with Frank Vahid in Fall 2020 . Basically CS120B part 2! We made 2 projects with Arduinos .
CS130,0.564," Computer Graphics with Tamar Shinar is a fair mix of programming and concept . There were two projects, weekly labs, a midterm and a final . Most difficult part of the class was the labs or those in the second half of the course with opengl ."
CS131,0.637, Just do a
CS135,0.873," Professor Chen is the best professor at BCOE, not intimidating and knowledgeable . Do the extra credit in the labs since they boost your grade by a lot . The lectures seem to be more about how the hardware makers created VR and how the device handles movement and creating the VR scene ."
CS141,0.373," This is the first 'hard' cs class usually taken by undergraduates, at least for me, and it's a tough one . A solid foundation of DS&A from CS014 is required to do well in this class . Take it with Patrick Miller, the best CS professor ever ."
CS142,0.681," This is basically the coding part of CS141 . Teaches you more about different ways to solve problems, as well as some parallelism, where you actually implement it ."
CS144,0.754," The first homework is pure biology, and the second is the hardest homework . There are no exams, but there is a final project, where you choose one topic out of 10 ."
CS147,0.855," Daniel Wong is GOAT'd, he's very empathetic and cares about his student . Exams were super fair, he does curve if your midterm grades are really bad . Overall, very easy and manageable class ."
CS150,0.749," No programming in this class, exams and homework are done in pencil and paper . Inductions can be hard to follow, but as long as you can do examples, you should be fine . Sample midterm was a lot harder than the actual midterm ."
CS152,0.484, One of the most difficult CS classes I have ever taken . Take this class (compilers) after taking automata avoid song avoid song . The lab is terrible. You have to build a compiler from scratch .
CS153,0.367," Operating Systems with Prof Abu-Ghazaleh is a pretty cool guy nonetheless and teaches the material very well . Labels are tough, worth 40% of your grade, but just ask for help and you should be fine . Quizzes every other week that you had to schedule at the testing center ."
CS160,0.199," Took this class with Zizhong Chen, but I think that he might be the only professor that teaches this so far . Took with Lesani, pretty easy, midterm an final were very similar to the homeworks ."
CS161,0.247," No final in this class, just 3 exams and 4 homeworks, where exams are 25%/ea . Homework problems and quizzes are worth 5% and 15% respectively . The material isn't too bad to learn, some of the stuff later in the class like VM and caches can get tricky ."
CS161L,0.775," Prof. Knight said he wanted to make it low stress, just learn the topics . One open note multiple choice quiz a week with questions that have 1 obvious answer and 3 joke answers ."
CS164,0.591," The class has a lot of information and a hefty amount of memorization and conceptual understanding required . K.K. Ramakrishnan is great, but the material is inherently dry ."
CS165,0.187, The class is really brutal because there's only a single exam which is worth a massive amount . Professor Qian provides many opportunities for overall grade extra credit (like 10-12% total) [COVID-19 ERA: SPRING 2020]
CS166,-0.025, Chinya Ravishankar is one of the worst professors you'll ever have in your life . The class went to hell as soon as the TAs went on strike and that was when we were working on the final part of our projects .
CS167,0.454," Ahmed Eldawy is an excellent professor, one of the best CS professors I've personally had at this university . The labs are very annoying and tedious so be ready to go to the TAs office hours . The exams are alright, I didn't do too well on them so I relied on labs, final project, hws, etc to bring me to a B ."
CS168,0.27," The lectures are really hard to follow . If you aren't a CEN/EE, leave while you still can . It's doable without, but it's definitely easier if you have that background ."
CS169,0.0,No comments.
CS170,0.725," As long as it’s taught by Eamonn Keogh you’ll have a great time . The tests might be relatively difficult, but overall the class isn't very demanding . Took it with Nader Senobari Shakibay ."
CS171,0.379, This is probably one of the hardest CS technical electives I have ever taken . Homeworks are done in Python on JupyterHub where he gives you a skeleton code .
CS172,0.868," The slides for the class have too much information on them, so it's hard to tell what to study for the exams . The homeworks can be difficult if not started early . The final project is done in either python or Java ."
CS173,0.96, Took Spring 2023 with Professor Dong . Mandatory attendance with easy attendance quizzes . 2 midterms and final that are almost exactly like practice ones she hands out beforehand . Recommend taking this class if you are interested in NLP .
CS175,0.886," Faloutsos is a great professor, and it's more fun if you participate (but it's also an 8am class). Attendance, reading, and participation are self-reported . Most of the grade hinges on your final investor pitch ."
CS179E,0.829," The class is just one big project with 4 phases . If you're a pro at Java and CS152, then this might be easier for you . The ta was very helpful as he helped my group understand the concept ."
CS179F,0.599," Take this class with Heng Yin. Choose one of his listed projects, find it somewhere online as someone’s hw assignment and list that as the source and work on your project . Ended with an A+ and honestly we didn’t even work till the last week and kept showing random code during the check-ins ."
CS179G,0.494," Plan, design, then build a project involving a database . Weekly status reports are straightforward and fairly quick . Enjoyable class overall overall ."
CS179J,0.974, I was pretty scared going into this course because I hated CS120B but it wasn't bad at all . You have a lot of leeway with what you want to do for your project .
CS179M,0.244, This class barely had any AI at all and was basically an extension and more complex version of the 8-puzzle project from CS170 . It had some business-like elements to this class such as preparing questions to ask the customer and presenting a project pitch .
CS179N,0.832, Meets once per week for one hour and one lab . All you have to do is make a game in a group of 4 to 5 people . It's a requirement that you have experience with a game engine like Unity or Unreal .
CS180,0.749," The whole class is esentially to build something really, but they give you a list of things at the beginning and you present a thing at the end . Make sure you have a solid team. Study up on some front-end tech like react or angular ."
CS181,0.925, Hardest class you will ever take in your entire life . Only take it if you are 100% into Computer Science . Programming assignments are 8% of your grade and there are 4 of them in the entire quarter .
CS182,0.897," The goal of the project is to get you familiar with testing and generating code coverage . The project isn't exactly graded on how correctly you test, but if you can successfully test and use your testing tools (i.e. JaCoCo for Java)"
CS183,0.532, It's an overview of managing/maintaining a UNIX server and it's a pretty nice class . It gives you some good breathing room for other classes as a CS major .
CS201,0.351," A lot of the course material isn't too difficult to grasp, but because there aren't a lot of examples, it can be hard to solve problems on the exams . The project can be very overwhelming, so start learning how to work with LLVM and Clang at the beginning of the quarter . There isn't a ton of resources on the material online (as is for most CS grad classes)"
CS202,0.586," Prof. Hyoseung Kim: Lots of research paper critiques, Lots of lab assignments . The material is not super difficult, but you definitely need to study ."
CS203,-0.048," Take this class with Prof Daniel Wong if you can, even if you're CS trash like me and have no interest in computer architecture . Midterm, project, and Final are crazy hard. Midterm and final were really straightforward as long as you did the assignments and study the sample(s) he provides ."
CS205,0.475, Prof. LePendu gives out a lot of bonus points for students . Grading is super lenient and Prof. Keogh gives out bonus points . Do NOT CHEAT and you'll get a good grade easily .
CS206,-0.421, Project and exams
CS210,-0.107," 80% of this class is linear algebra . 40% of the grade is homework . 30% is midterm, 30% final . Professor was very fast paced and difficult to follow because of that ."

CS218,0.599," Prof Lonardi is the best for this course and is a very good grader . The subject itself is difficult but with enough effort, you'll ace the class . Finals carry a lot of weight ."
CS226,0.807, Prof. Eldawy is amazing and a very good grader! 5 coding
CS229,-0.323," Shelton is awesome, but holy hell this class is hard . The saving grace is that fat curve; you can expect a B as long as you put in honest effort . You're gonna get your ass kicked by that brutal 3 hour final ."
CS235,0.746," 60% of your grade is a project that you need to present as a research report . The other 40% consists of quizzes (reading research papers), the midterm, and the final ."

CS240,0.784, Course entirely based on project(100%) Prof Faloutsos is very cool and grades well if you do a good job on the project
CS242,0.905," The grade depends on quizzes, project, 1 assignment and a midterm(40%) Grading is super easy and the subject is a sure-shot A. Prof. Hristidis is amazing!"
CS247,-0.296," Professor teaches only theory, the grade distribution is 3 full exams . TA’s were helpful, but the lack of gap in the problem sets that appear in exam and the exercise questions is night and day ."
CS251,-0.833," The material itself isn't extremely tough, but the lack of guidance on the labs will throw you for a loop . Overall, one of my least favorite CS classes I've taken at UCR ."
CS253,0.192, The project was a bit tricky due to concurrency needed and trouble debugging that . The tests are free formed so be prepared to info dump so be sure to keep up and study . Professor Ravishankar is very knowledge in the area .
DNCE005,0.558," Contact improvisation is a very touchy class . If you’re the type of person who wouldn’t mind giving someone a full body massage, DO NOT take it ."
DNCE007,-0.091," Professor Reynoso is extremely passionate about the topic which is great, but sometimes he expects you to know as much as he does . During his lectures, he presents slides with A LOT of important information, but it is kind of messy and hard to read . There is 1 midterm, 1 paper, and 1 final ."
DNCE007W,0.716, The class tutor didn't help me at all so I would definitely recommend going to ARC if you need a tutor/someone to help you with the essays . Lots of essays so just be sure to pace yourself .
DNCE012,0.746," This is honestly an easy A if you just do these few things . Go to class, she takes attendance and so those points do in fact matter to your overall grade . Take pictures of every single slide as that can help you in your essays . For the essays, go to the ARC to get help on your writing ."
DNCE065A,0.726, Intro to latin dance: Show up to dance. Just show up and dance
ECON002,0.636," Matthew Lang does a great job in explaining concepts, and if you pay attention all of his exams are pretty easy . No essays, no attendance required for either lecture or discussion, recorded lectures, every assignment is on canvas including midterm and final, and extra credit opportunities ."
ECON003,0.787," There are 8 quizzes worth 10 points each (you only need to get 50 points total to get full credit for the quizzes) There is also free ""good citizen"" points - don't disrespect other studends and you get the points . Discussion sections are optional so you can ditch if u want ."
ECON003H,0.982," Took this with Joab during COVID, he is an amazing professor! He is truly passionate about the subject and enjoys teaching it . Content is easy to understand and he was very understanding of the online environment ."
ECON006,-0.011, Dr. Tellez Foster is a passionate and engaging teacher . The material is very hard to self-study for and the textbook is sooo boring . Make sure to go to his study sessions .
ECON101,0.539," Prof. Matt Lang teaches this (Fall 2018) - get him if he is teaching it . Show up for the lab and discussion portions are  mandatory . Material is pretty easy, the textbook isn't the greatest, but using Google/YouTube should help ."
ECON102,0.619, Professor McLaren is a sweetheart but he is a horrible lecturer . I relied on YouTube to learn the material and found lecture useless . His midterm and tests are surprisingly very easy . If you do the Problem Sets you should be okay on his tests .
ECON103,0.153, First midterm was hard but the TA's really helped afterwords . Midterm is doable with a lot of studying . Final is very hard . There is a curve at the end .
ECON104A,0.282, The professor was very nice and understanding but the material was math based and challenging . The most important thing about this class is to do the practice problems and understand what's going on when you do the homework . The exams are almost identical to the sample ones given .
ECON104B,0.121," Class was the worst Economics class I have taken so far at UCR . Pay attention in class, homework assignment every week, can find it online . Before Midterm has a review session which is practically the exam . Final is cumulative but the questions are from homework assignments ."
ECON105A,0.433," There's 2 midterms and the final Fall 2021 (Online), Prof. Lee - Pretty easy class, most of his problem sets were online and midterm/final were open book . Attendance was not required and problem sets carried my grade ."
ECON105B,-0.049," Professor Riyad Abubaker's lectures are incredibly difficult to follow along, the slides consist of vague graphs and he would write notes on the whiteboard with messy/small handwriting . Lee Dongwon uploads his notes and they are really great, I can always understand whats in the problem sets when I find the correct notes ."
ECON106,0.637," This is the first quarter that this class was taught, and she used R to do data analysis . There were no exams, just 2 lecture quizzes per week, a weekly lab, and a huge end of the quarter project ."
ECON107,0.08," Professor Shi Shi kind of boring and lectures make you want to sleep . Professor Riyad Abubaker's stories are interesting and are a nice break from econometrics . Overall, I got an A in the class ."

ECON109,0.826," I took this class with Silviu Velovici in the Spring of 2024 . This class was a bit confusing and disorganized . Overall, I finished the class with an A despite not doing much ."
ECON124A,0.402, Took it with Jeff Allen . Just remember the major events and how they connect to global economic development . Would take again .
ECON129,0.56," Health Economic with Matt Lang is not hard he only had 4 quizzes, a midterms and a final . Just remembering how the graphs move and why is super important ."
ECON130,-0.385," Took with Kenneth Kim during Fall '22 (in-person). Probably the worst professor I have ever seen in Economics, lecture compromises of 50+ slides that are copied/pasted from the textbook . During lecture, he glances over all the slides giving vague information to each new topic presented to class . Midterm consisted of multiple choice questions from our weekly quizzes and FRQs from practice sets ."
ECON135,0.863, The stock market class (business elective) with Professor Silviu Velovici . It's basically a class with a lot of accounting stuff . Cheat sheets are allowed for the two midterms and the final .
ECON138,0.902," Fall 2023 - Took the Course with Professor Matt Lang, The class is one of the best here at UCR . Allow yourself time for projects as they can be time consuming if done at the last minute"
ECON143,0.823," Joab Corey’s an interesting and fun teacher, relatively easy class, no discussion section! Had Econ143 with Joab corey . Midterm and finals were huge (25% each) but not too difficult ."
ECON152,0.7," There was one midterm, one cumulative final, and 4 easy homework assignments . Halfway through the class, the professor changed the grading scale because he thought it was too easy . This class is very exam heavy but he gives away test questions in the homework and in the review lecture ."
ECON160,0.0," Course was heavy on math and required most econ knowledge from macro/micro . Professor goes over slides very fast and does not have organized notes . Curve was big tho, most of class got C/D ."
ECON162,0.019," Quizzes every lecture, HW weekly, midterm, and final . The midterm and final was just the homework problems with numbers changed . True/False explain questions that the professor mentions in review session ."
ECON163,-0.921," Urmee Khan is a nice professor, but her notes are difficult to follow along because of grammar/diction issues and the slides can sometimes be vague . This class requires constant self-study and going to class to ask questions is a must ."
ECON171,0.366, Easy A with the overall grade curve at the end but avoid if you aren't into the whole read off the slides for the entire lecture thing . Avoid groups of 4-5 for both homework assignments during the quarter .
ECON178,0.977," This class should be manageable if you take it with Bree Lang . She will most likely post lecture videos, slides, and notes so that's a plus . You have to do reading assignments and lecture quizzes, but you don't have to get a perfect score in order to get full credit for them ."
ECON181,-0.759," Prof lectures could be better, the slides are not the most helpful for studying . I recommend recording lectures and listening back because answers won't be in the slides . I would not take this course again ."
EDUC005,0.373," Professor Gutierrez is super easy. No tests or quizzes. Just 2 two-page papers for homework and midterm and final are papers too . Lecture is just taking notes, but it's kinda useless and so are the readings . Discussion is basically office hours. No hw but readings every week ."
EDUC010,0.677," A high schooler could pass this class, but honestly, this class was quite useless to me . It was a lot of generic information that a senior doesn't really need, it is more geared towards freshman . The prof posts relevant study guides which makes things even easier ."
EDUC023,-0.296," There are ""modules"" (lectures and readings) every week and at most 2 quizzes due every week . There are 2 projects, no essays"
EDUC032A,0.892," Slides are not posted so you have to go to class to hear the readings, no attendance taken . Only papers, but no tests/quizzes . Content was pretty interesting, but can get boring during lectures ."
EDUC040,0.361," Taught by Begoña Echeverria who reminds me of a strict annoying high school teacher, the type who yells at you when your phone is out . Wouldn't recommend as an “easy class” unless you like history and writing ."
EDUC042,0.989, Dr. Lee's teaching style allows for everyone to participate and overall the most welcoming course I've ever taken . Weekly reading response assessments (which are 2/3 - 1 full page) about 2 articles read per week . I had Sofia Rivera as my TA and I absolutely love her!
EDUC043,0.235," The only grades youll get is an in person midterm, take home paper, and final . The readings are super long and boring! TA: rodaina really came through ."
EDUC049,0.128," Judith Kroll only went to class 6 times this quarter, got a C on the final, and received an A+ as"
EDUC050,0.887," The class material is pretty interesting, it's about the NCAA and student athletes . There's a number of weekly assignments due on different days and times that can be hard to keep up with unless you write them down/set reminders . The midterm wasn't too bad, the prof tells you what will be on it ."
EDUC051,0.863, This class was async and we had weekly discussion boards on canvas and video quizzes . By far the easiest class I have taken. You learn a lot about the higher education system .
EDUC061,0.883," Dr. Lussier is funny, caring, and makes lecture interesting . I would recommend going to lectures because she will randomly give out worksheets, which counts as points . Discussion sections are mandatory ."
EDUC104,0.0, She has a lot of weekly fluff assignments but doesn't grade them just for completion . Watch out for that
EDUC105,0.951, Towne is a tough grader but the class is great and he is very passionate about teaching . You'll
EDUC122,0.938, Samia is a great TA . There are no group projects and the final is a 8-10 paged paper . The videos are easy to follow .
EDUC123,0.867, This class was easy and fully online . The discussion boards seem easy and this TA grades too harshly . Not the best upper div EDUC class you could take .
EDUC150,0.739, Professor Comeaux Spring 22. Easy class . Lots of busy work but it is easy . One test and one essay for the final .
EDUC152,-0.412," Easy class, but it is a little unorganized . Online and lecture and discussion were mandatory . The TAs are very chill, my grade never dropped below an A ."
EDUC154,0.968, Professor Iglesias is a great TA . You can easily get an A for putting little effort . This class goes over DEI Initiatives .
EDUC162,-0.194," Prof. Eui Kim is not the best, not the worst, just okay . Easy quizzes and discussion board assignments were easy . Group project for the final was very annoying ."
EDUC181,0.717," Loved his energy and because of the modality of my class in particular it was really easy . Had to cancel lecture/change it to Zoom due to being sick or couldn't make it, and as a result cut back on what was on tests ."
EDUC184,0.784, This class is harder than it looks. The quizzes are difficult. The midterm is a video you have to make which is easy. Anna was a great TA. But the lecture content is boring to sit through .
EE001A,-0.026," EE001A will be hard for 99% of people, but EE001B will be even harder for you . Professor El-sharif really cares about his students and is quite funny too . The class was terribly mismanaged ."
EE001B,0.422," The biggest predictor of success is your 1A knowledge . If you have a solid foundation, a B or an A will be in your grasp . The lab goes off the 10 point scale for difficulty as it was out of sync with the class ."
EE003,0.382, Only one professor ever teaches this and he is pretty terrible at teaching this content . Test
EE005,-0.392," Professor Vaezi is a funny guy but horrible teacher . Exams had things that weren't gone over in class, and I passed by self studying ."
EE010,0.267," There were no tests, but the professor gave homework that was not related to any of the learning we did . 90% of the grade was attendance and the other 10% was like 4 10 minute homeworks . Most of the material covered is stuff you should already know if you played with Arduino in high school ."
EE016,0.699, Professor Samet Oymak taught the Python programming class for the first time . The class is packed with information . Midterm tests you on almost all of these things . Final focuses on linear regression and Fourier transform mainly .
EE020,0.371," First half of the class was extremely easy . Second half is harder, but it shouldn't too bad if you study seriously . The prof gives you a practice final but you shouldn't follow it at all ."
EE020B,0.746," Only went to like 3 lectures but managed to get an A-. Apparently he's only failed like 1 person in the decade or so he's been teaching . Barely mentioned electric circuits, it's just matrix math & linear systems ."
EE030A,-0.354," Average midterm score was 25%, with only 5 out of 110 students getting a passing score of over 70% . Her slides are a direct copy and paste from the textbook, and she reads off the slides like a high schooler giving a presentation . Claims to also have 21 years of experience but my classmates and I cannot find her on ratemyprof . Offers little to no valuable teachings about how to solve a given problem ."
EE100A,0.783," Took with Ming Liu (Spring 2021), and it was a somewhat enjoyable experience . Understand BJTs and MOSFETs thoroughly ."
EE100B,0.82, The circuits you study and have to build in lab are pretty interesting . Ming Liu is a really forgiving grader and gives a lot of partial credit so make sure to attempt every problem on exams .
EE105,0.123," Jay's strict homework policy combined with his ingenious idea of MULTIPLYING quiz grades with their respective homeworks is a recipe for trouble . Skip out on lecture and you're pretty screwed, unless you take to reading the book . There is absolutely NO CURVE in the class ."
EE106,0.084," Prof Karydis is not a bad person but he rambles alot and reads off the slides . His lab experience was also terrible because of the TAs, xiaoao song and ashok ."
EE110A,-0.165, Prof Shaolei Ren curved individual exams heavy and allowed cheat sheets . Material is not that dense but it is critical for EE 110B .
EE110B,0.637, This class is basically a deeper dive into the content from EE110A focusing on concepts that come up in signal processing . It's super abstract with relatively little explicit discussion of actual circuits . Prof. Hua lectures by just writing shit on the board for 50 mins .
EE111,-0.062," Took with Sheldon, two midterms and final . Midterms were easy, but very hard final . Look at the lecture slides and use the lecture"
EE114,0.824, First half is super easy basic probability but it ramps up in the second half . Overall not that bad if you get the concepts . Basically just a statistics class cosplaying as an EE
EE115,0.899," Matt Vaezi is a passionate educator, but I get the feeling he is not formally trained . He is pretty unorganized and he showed up for lecture in-between meetings . It was hard to connect the high-level concepts in lecture and the math heavy homework ."
EE116,0.321, The grading is so strict and you can seldom get the score if you made any mistakes in the tests . All course material are handwritten papers and no more examples for the problems .
EE120A,0.424," First half of the course is essentially CS061 material, while second half gets slightly rough due to HLSM, etc. The labs are written in Verilog, which honestly was the toughest part of the class . Class is one of the easiest classes ive ever taken ."
EE120B,0.456, This is written from the perspective of an EE student . The difficulty of labs is not bad but they take so much work . The exams are fair but wouldn't recommend taking with Brisk either .
EE123,0.936," Roman Chomko said the class was originally supposed to be for grad students . The labs were easy though, just follow directions and done. Labs definitely help your understanding of the lecture ."
EE128,0.815," Super easy exams that are open book open note, no HW, and labs weren't too bad either . For the project you just either gotta build something that includes two of the topics discussed in class, or something"
EE132,0.862," The class, while challenging, is manageable all the way up until finals week . Beware of the final, which is worth 40% of your grade . It's one of the more interesting courses you will take as an Electrical Engineering major ."
EE138,0.894," Took with Professor Haberer . Her slides have a lot of information, but overall the class was fair and she is very nice! Just make a study guide of the quizzes and homework and you'll do fine on exams ."
EE139,0.258, The class is mostly key terms and some definition not heavy math based . The first midterm was super easy if you study the midterm review . The second one was free response which was a little harder .
EE141,0.307," The material is pretty hard, the professor is good in class but lecture notes are trash, however he curves hard"
EE144,0.474, This class is cross-listed with ME 144 and so it has mostly ME and EE students but it feels more like an ME and CS class than any EE class . Its still worth taking for EE majors who want to work with robots since it doesn't have the ME prerequisite that EE 145 does .
EE252,0.718," Fairly easy class, and"
EE255,0.812," If you took CS153 or CS202, the content should look very familiar . Fairly straight forward but interesting content, and very cool labs ."
EE284,0.599," The textbook is Modern Robotics by Lynch and Park, the class covers chapters 1-10 and Appendix C . The lab section is very connected to the lecture, you must know lecture content to succeed in lab ."
ENGL001A,0.536," There's 3 hand written essays, 2 typed papers, multiple quizzes (one every class), journal entries, and a final exam . Kathleen Gurnett is an extremely hard grader and super picky . Albert Anthony grades very hard and has it out for his students ."
ENGL001B,0.465, There's about seven English professors for this class . Avoid Benedict Jones AT ALL COSTS . Colin Innes is undoubtedly the easiest one . Shane Shukis is a great professor .
ENGL001C,0.503, Instructor Enriquez was firmly one of the best instructors I've ever attended . Professor Hackelton was a good professor but a hard grader . The class itself should not have been so difficult .
ENGL004,0.353," The only good thing I could say is that I didn't have to buy the ""Write It"" textbook . The teacher graded harshly due to the fact that no one participated in the class . Erie Leduc is hands down the best English professor ."
ENGL01PA,0.163," A very chill class with little homework but the grading was absurd and tanks your GPA . A super difficult teacher, never gave As . His standards were ambiguous and contradicting ."
ENGL01PL,0.846, There are about five essays including the final which is an essay . Dr. Musgrove is a really sweet teacher .
ENGL008,0.864, Make sure you do well on your presentations and group one took it in person during Summer 23 . Also don't be afraid to ask questions .
ENGL012A,0.935, Prof Guenther gave a lot of material each week but most of it was really interesting . We were assigned 3 papers but got to choose 2 of the 3 to complete . If you are interested in the subject then it is great
ENGL012B,0.716," Online Summer course with Francisco Ramos . There were 4 assignments, each being 1 - 2.5 pages (MLA format) For the online course we only had to attend class once a week . Textbook is given for free by professor along with any other reading materials ."
ENGL012I,0.622," The professor is very passionate and humorous about the subject he teaches . There is a lot of reading, but nothing too much . There's a few papers that aren't too bad ."
ENGL012R,0.939," Prof Gutierrez is great, and if you're interested in Chicano theory at all you'll love this class . The only assignments are journals every week, and class time just consists of watching presentations by other students . Attendance isn't mandatory, and she uploads recordings of lectures later on for whoever needs it ."
ENGL012S,0.922, The midterm and finals are both online and mostly multiple choice . The readings were really interesting but it is absolutely a lot to read and a total time killer . I'd say take this class if you have an easy quarter but it won't fit in with a STEM schedule .
ENGL017,0.893, Take good notes and try to read as much of the plays as possible and you'll be fine . Had Professor Kenny and easy multiple choice
ENGL020A,0.852," Professor Brayman's really nice and is passionate about what she teaches, but she tends to drone on during lectures . Midterm for this class was tricky, and most didn't really pass it . Essays are pretty toughly graded, but grades are consistently updated on iLearn ."
ENGL020B,0.888," Taken in Summer 2023 with Misha Choudhry . Misha operates on a ""no fail"" model, where assignments are given full points upon completion ."
ENGL020C,0.758," Professor Jennifer Doyle does not believe in 'grading', so she has a list of assignments that you can do . The way she structures the prompts is that there is no correct idea, as long as you are able to relate the core concepts and theories with the assigned readings . The class structure was constantly changing, so it was slightly confusing ."
ENGL102W,-0.272," Wasn’t too bad. Had to write 5,000 words total this quarter but it was broken up into mini weekly 500 word assignments . Finished with an A+ ."
ENGL128X,0.888," The class focused on the works of Toni Morrisson so it was really interesting reads . With Professor Nunley, there are no writing assignments, just a midterm and a final ."
ENGL141,0.512," There were 2 papers, a midterm, and a final, but i did not expect this class to be as hard as it was . He grades really hard and gave me a b for both of my papers and a B for my MLA FORMAT ."
ENGL179A,-0.791, Summer 2023 Online with Brandy Lewis is by far the worst professor/ta I have ever had. Talks about furries way too much. You don't learn anything at all and they are a harsh grader. Final is an essay about a book that we don't even talk about
ENGR001,0.275," ""Mandatory"" attendance (just get someone to send you the attendance link) Weekly homework that takes 20-30 min tops . No final or midterm . You learn a lot and Professor LePendu is amazing ."
ENGR101,-0.19," The 3rd year equivalent of ENGR001 was just 3 homeworks, and a final . The final was only hard because none of us really studied for it. Show up, learn about industry stuff, leave."
ENGR118,0.128," With prof. K barsanti, this class is easy if you habe programming experience, (understand function calls, executions, declarations, and how to work with arrays) If you dont then it will set you back, lectures are boring she reads off the powerpoint and always be in class cause she gives clicker and it counts toward grade . Not a hard class but Barsanti is new and very disorganized at times ."

ENSC110,0.918, ENSC 110 with King-Fai was not to bad as long as you kept up with lectures and homework . It's a solid class if you're looking to reinforce your stats foundation . It might not delve as deep into environmental applications as one might hope .
ENSC120,0.243, Midterm is pretty long but the final is simpler (still long tho) Grading is fair as long as you study in detail . Most of the info is in Dr. Hopkins' slides and lots is repeated throughout the quarter .
ENTM020,0.971, I took this course with Boris Bar. Such a sweet and understanding professor so take it with him! It's a relative small class and that affects the structure of the class . Lecture and discussion are usually on the same day and attendance is mandatory .

ETST011,0.93," As a first year who has 0 interest in linguistics and about ethnic studies in general, I won't recommend it as an ""easy pass"" class . Lots of reading needs to be done, a 6 page autobiography, and you WILL NOT PASS THE EXAMS if you didn't do any of the reading . Not necessary to attend lecture, but you're required to attend discussion ."
ETST012,0.324," Easy class except for final essay, absolute cakewalk for STEM majors looking to take an easy breadth class . Spend time on research paper and go to office hours, final is 70 MCQ and 3 short answer questions ."

ETST102,0.827, Every day we were assigned 3-4 readings and we just had to respond to one of them . Each response was 5% of our grade . Participation was 25% and it was just chiming in every now and then . Final was 35% and was just a big essay .

ETST189,0.927," The class was boring honestly we had 3 hrs discussions. Make sure to participate, he takes notes on who spoke . Discussions are based on films (1-2 hours) & readings (~30-40 pages) assigned that week. You submit weekly 5 quotes which is like 30% of your grade lol. The final is a term paper based on your selection of films & readings ."

FREN15A,-0.714," Christine Duvergé is pretty nice overall, but she will be very critical of your writing and holds nothing back . Do not take this class if you don't have a great grasp on French, because it will be a huge amount of work for you . She wants you to write about your deep feelings/someone who influenced your childhood in a super meaningful way ."
GBST001,0.66," The course had a midterm, a final, quizzes based on reading during discussion, and a paper . The paper was fun-ish to write bc you wrote a story using the topics you learned in class with a bit of research/citation included . Overall, would recommend the class if you're willing to do the work ."

GEO002,0.826, Tim Lyons is funny and all but he can be a real tool sometimes which made me not want to go to class . The class is a breeze if you're a STEM major because it's designed for non-math/science majors to fulfill a requirement .

GEO011,0.295," Professor Wei Liu explains the material pretty well, GEO011 is comparable to GEO009 if you've taken that before .

GSST013S,0.701," Prof Guenter taught asynchronously with 2-3 hour long recorded lectures . Easy participation points available, a learning worksheet due every week, and 3 opportunities to write 2 papers . No final! Reading/Viewing material was sometimes a lot. Highly recommend nonetheless ."
GSST016,0.466," This class is new so I recommend going to her office hours for help/to discuss . There's no tests, just 2 essays for midterms and one final document of short answers/a really short essay . Make sure you at least skim the readings and take good notes ."

HNPG016,0.473," Prof Tyler liked to rant about off-topic subjects in her mandatory seminars . She assigned annotating homework weekly, but never posted it on time and when asked about it, ended up extending the date to weeks after it was originally due .

MATH006B,0.396," The work itself is easy, but if you have Lizheng Tao consider yourself done for . Curve is strong though, but there is a redo your lowest page on the midterm from 6A .

MATH009C,0.076, This class mainly covers power series and is an easy A for most people . Ziv Ran is probably the worst professor in the 9 series . If you are good at math and can self teach you can survive and get a good grade .

MATH121,0.287," The homework for this class was very difficult, and the TA that we had was no help .

Some of her final exam problems were exactly the same as the practice final she gave out ."
MATH126,0.667," The first half of the course is easy enough, mainly graph theory and the like . Discussion was held on Tuesday, the day before the hw was due, which was a big help due to the TA going over homework problems . There were two midterms and one final exam ."
MATH131,0.641," CS011/MATH011 is a good course to prepare or reinforce the type of concepts for 131 . Professor Zhu is a great professor, it's hard to teach Math131 in general . The material itself is not hard but it is a proof based class ."

MATH135B,0.813," 135B is a continuation of 135A, and I'd say that the difficulty of the material in 135B wasn't really any harder or easier than in 135A . I ended up just reading the book and going to discussions instead of going to lecture and was fine ."
MATH136,0.926," Math136 is number theory and I took is with professor Livesay . Even though it was his first time teaching number theory, he did an excellent job . Homework assignments are lengthy but not too difficult ."
MATH144,0.803," The material itself starts off not too bad but in my experience quickly became very abstract and difficult to understand . Homework, midterm, and final were all graded pretty strictly but the curve is generous . All around, a decently hard class ."
MATH145A,0.0,No comments.
MATH145B,0.618," I think this class was difficult just because it's Topology . If you can avoid Topology in general, I would. It's a confusing course. I took 145A with Schultz ."
MATH146A,0.109, Math 146A is Ordinary Differential Equations and mostly covers slightly more intricate problems as compared to Math046 . IMO the class was straight forward and the tests were not too difficult although the HW can be time consuming .
MATH146B,0.0,No comments.
MATH146C,0.763," Math146C is Partial Differential Equations, this course unlike parts A and B can be quite challenging . Understanding the method for separation of variables and the Sturm-Liouville problem are essentials ."
MATH147,0.883, Math147 is Fourier Analysis and true to its name is a pure analysis course . Dr. Lapidus often teaches the course as an elective and thus effort will often be rewarded with a minimum of a B+.
MATH148,-0.47, There were no quizzes or tests; I had no idea what was being taught . There were 2 homeworks made up of problems from the book and problems he gave during lecture . Be sure to take notes during lecture because he doesn't post his online .
MATH149A,-0.459," I took this class with Ryan Aschoff (who is a TA) during the Summer of 2023 . The homework was a lot more difficult than the tests, but Dr. Costello provides you with practice tests from previous years that really help you prepare . Homework was 30%, Midterm was 20%, and Final was 50%."
MATH151A,0.765," Fall20 with Dr. Gavosto (awesome professor) No exams . Weekly hw assignments, every other week we would have additional assignments worth more points . Some extra credit opportunities ."
MATH153,0.896," This class was really easy when you take it with Schultz. ALTHOUGH, I took it as a fully online course (hello COVID-19 pandemic). He literally gives you everything you need to do well! Also, the content was pretty interesting. I think it could be difficult as an in-person course, but not really ."
MATH165A,-0.239," Math165A is Complex Variables and IMO is relatively straight forward . If you are good with calculus and good with complex numbers, this class should be cake walk . Theorems are not to tough to prove but the HW out of the Brown/Churchill book can be a bit of a pain ."
MATH165B,0.718," Math165B is the second portion to complex variables . Unlike in part A, 165B offers a bit more intricacy when it comes to the proofs . The HW is still tedious and full of repetitive calculations and some tricky proof questions ."
MATH168,-0.248," If you do all of your assignments on time, you should be able to get an A, it's really hard to get anything lower than an A . Be prepared to do"
MATH171,0.973," The class was hard and pretty time consuming but I thoroughly enjoyed it . We were graded on hw, worksheets, a midterm, and a final . Exams were proctored over zoom ."
MCBL121,0.693," There is a lot of content, so this class requires heavy memorization . The exams contain both MC and FRQ, so sometimes it is a bit of a time crunch to complete everything in 50 minutes . The class also gives up to 100 points of extra credit (can boost your grade up to 10%) from extra credit quizzes and extra credit points awarded by the TA for the group presentations ."
MCBL121L,0.853," Lab reports are easy but long and tedious, so don't make the same mistake I did and start late . You can expect to pull an all-nighter if you start the night before . Coffey grades somewhat harshly on the scientific paper ."
MCBL123,0.338," Rao gave weird test questions and stuff that wasn't really mentioned in class/taught on the slides . The last half of the class was taught by Dr. Morrison, who was much more straightforward . Memorization is heavily tested in this course ."
MCBL125,0.794, Class based mostly on lab work--3 days a week . Prof and TA kinda unorganized but overall grading was extremely fair . There is a scientific paper on your lab work and a final presentation on personal research .
MCBL126,0.846, Dr. Borneman is super nice and grades very fairly . This class tests common sense and knowledge but the tests will get harder over time . There is memorization of class material tested on the 2nd midterm and final .
MCBL133,0.525," Dr. Aronson is a very nice professor, and she is very enthusiastic about environmental microbiology . The grading was very lenient imo, but you have you pay attention to what she says in class ."
MCBL139,0.924," Quinn McFrederick was an awesome and enthusiastic professor . Going to class is important though, as the test questions are more of what he says verbally than on the slide ."
MCS001,0.076," The class assignments were relatively easy (glossary assignments) and there were no exams . However, the class was extremely disorganized, do not take this with Professor Keith Harris!!! He was never prepared for lecture, it was very hard to understand what he was saying, and he was very unclear with directions . TAs are more stable than he is ."
MCS005,0.567," The only downside of this course lectures arent reuploaded, but fairly simple class . All lectures were prerecorded and discussions aren't mandatory . The lectures are kind of boring and long but would have probably been better in person ."
MCS010,0.542," Rachel (TA) was the best!! she replied fast on emails, graded things on time, and created summaries for the readings . Attend review sessions before the midterm and final and you should be okay for exams . Midterms are specific about the readings and lecture notes ."
MCS015,0.659," Grade is determined on effort, bigger assignments are left optional but as long as you turn in all the assignments you will get an A . Highly recommend if the"
MCS020,0.663," Prof Burrill is an excellent and cares about his students truly . Midterms weren't proctored, and we had a generous amount of time to complete them. Midterms were essays, and nearly everyone got A's ."
MCS047,0.932," Professor Jeong is an amazing professor with such passion for Korean film . You watch films, answer weekly discussion questions, and take a multiple-choice weekly quiz . Lecture slides are asynchronous with no attendance or discussion section ."
MCS154,0.832, Overall an interesting class with not too much effort required . Lots of the class is student presentations . Some of the readings can be a bit long .
ME002,0.165," Me2 is designed to make you think like an engineer, not teach you material, which trips up a lot of people... Questions are based on “figure out how to solve the problem” instead of “plug numbers into an equation”"
ME009,0.606," If you just read the textbook and do well on the CAD Assignments (CAD is 40% of your grade), you'll be fine . The questions on the Midterm and Final were almost identical and looked like it turned the textbook readings into questions ."
ME010,0.342, Prof. Eskandari taught the class very well . Tons of time put in outside of class to understand concepts that Stahovich zooms through in lecture .
ME018A,0.663," ME18 (Intro to MatLab) isn't meant to teach coding skills . Many MEs hate coding or have no experience with it, and ME18 is a chill A :)"
ME018B,0.107," ME018 was split into 18A and 18B beginning Fall 2018 . Many MEs hate coding or have no experience with it, and ME18 isn’t meant to teach those skills ."
ME103,0.09," Professor Xu is funny and all, but he doesnt really know how to teach . No midterm only, quizzes and final"
ME100A,0.347, This class was one of my easiest ME courses so far (would give a 2.5 difficulty) I took it with Professor ChenLi (Fall Quarter) His class is generously curved and he is a rather good professor . Some might have trouble understanding him due to his Chinese accent .
ME110,0.262, Professor Eskandari is an amazing professor . Exams are very fair but beware of pop quizzes . Kumar went super easy on the first midterm and then made the second one deadly hard .
ME113,0.553, I believe the class was difficult because the TA's teachings were inconsistent with that of the professor's . The professor's office hours are extremely helpful and she actually is a good professor . The class was challenging but it was a good experience .
ME114,0.733, Took it with Professor Eskandari . She is an amazing professor and will explain all the concepts thoroughly . The only downside is that she loves giving pop quizzes .
ME118,0.217," Matlab is important but barely relevant to final grade . A lot of math, linear algebra and differential equations . Exams and project pretty intense ."
ME120,0.203," Avoid professor Vuong! Shes a great helpful person, but teaching isn't really for her . Erfan Nozari's lectures were very theory heavy and told you the ""why"" behind everything ."
ME135,-0.202, Venky takes textbooks problems and creates his own formulas and writes class notes . Strategy is probably to understand his impossible class notes and learn from other online sources . Will take a lot of time and effort studying with friends to understand anything .
ME156,0.935, Content on the exams wasn't even in the book . I stopped attending lectures around week 6 and just studied on my own . Somehow I got a B+ but was beyond stressed out the entire time .
ME170A,0.769," The class material is diverse, but relatively simple . Take the labs seriously, as the lab memos (the assignments) make up most of the class grade . The final was a bit harder than the midterm so I had a false sense of security that almost made me lose my A ."
ME180,0.253," One of the Mechanical Engineering Tech Electives, one of the coolest TE's out there, if ur interested in light waves, polarization, refraction, etc. Course still in development . Prof. Luat Vuong did not test on the difficult stuff ."

MSE160,-0.764, Her midterm was 70 questions in 70 minutes . Her quizzes in lab are so oddly specific and timed so it's almost as if they expect you to memorize every small detail about the machinery . She is not lenient what so ever .
MUS001,0.784, Frances Moore is a super nice violinist . Just do the work and put some effort and you'll get an A Super Easy A . Attendance is mandatory tho .
MUS002,0.332," Dr. Walter Clark is good. He doesn't care if you don't show up, though you REALLY should because he doesn't upload lecture notes . Just go to lecture and copy what he writes down + you'll be completely fine ."
MUS005,0.974, Women in Music with Professor Xochitl Chavez was an easy course but it does require work . Presentation lectures will not be posted on iLearn so take notes and read the book . There are listening parts to the exam that is best done by taking time listening to the examples required every week .
MUS006,0.875," Professor Nana is a great teacher, if you want to know more about music from different cultures, this is a class for you . Make sure to attend lectures (quizzes will be based heavily on them). Professor was so understanding he cancelled one of the quizzes and the final due to COVID ."
MUS008,0.021," There are 4 quizzes (not cumulative) and 1 essay, no final and no homework . Dr. Wong is very engaging and is enthusiastic about the material . She uses PollEverywhere for participation so attendance is needed ."
MUS010,0.823," I took this class fully online with Professor Moore . It was pretty easy, although it was hard to learn music online . Concepts are"
MUS012,0.857," Dr. Panikker taught this course Fall 23 . Mandatory lectures and homework due every lecture . No midterm, and final was a paper on a topic related to the class . Very easy and insightful, recommend if interested in ethnomusicology ."
MUS014,0.361," Go to discussion, don't procrastinate the essay, exams is stuff on lectures . You should probably"
MUS016,-0.361, Walter Clark's exams have a listening portion (music) and a written portion . Memorizing composers and the songs they wrote is crucial during the exams .
MUS017,-0.231," Took it with Chavez, exams were fair but a little bit on the hard side . There were two midterms and 1 final I took Xochilt Chavez online,"
MUS018,0.747," Took it with Prof Walter Clark and he was honestly the best . Only need to go to lecture to write down notes he puts on projector . Grading policy is straightforward, but the only thing I wasn't a big fan of was the mandatory attendance for lecture ."

NASC093,-0.358," Freshmen Advising Seminar: Just show up, take notes, and learn . The classes are both pass/fail so it isn't bad but if you miss a class that is your only strike . Miss more than one and you will be failed for both the discussion section and lecture section ."
NASC198,0.511,
PBPL001,0.559," This class is basically Busywork: The Class, and I would strongly, STRONGLY advise against taking this class if you don't need to . Exams are fair and easy. Weekly readings but he goes over it during lectures . Readings are pretty lengthy. Dr.Ahumada . If you don’t delay this class is a cakewalk ."
PBPL002,0.499," There is a midterm and a final, and weekly quizzes . Optional debates that you can do but it is limited and assigned during the first lecture ."
PBPL004,0.811," The class is 2 papers, 4 discussion posts, a midterm and a final . The test questions are straight from lecture too . Took it with Serieux Lubin ."

PHIL001,0.144," You don't even have to read for this class just memorize the slides and listen to the lectures . Paying attention and reading the passage ensures an easy B+ or A . No mid term, no final, just 3 papers throughout the quarter ."
PHIL002,0.561," Took it with professor Swanson . Just 3 papers, rarely attended lecture all slides are online but ask the TAs for help if you want a good grade on your paper . It seems straightforward but they have high expectations for them ."
PHIL003,0.957, This class definitely requires some effort but honestly it was pretty interesting and I really liked
PHIL003W,0.464," The readings/lectures are very long and sometimes confusing . The professor is also boring and the readings can become quite difficult to understand . There are no books to buy, everything is supplied with PDFs ."
PHIL004,0.415," This class isn't offered every quarter, according to my TA . Professor Cherry Myisha's class is fun because it talks about the root and foundations of races . There are 3 HW assignments (based on 2 questions from the textbook), one midterm and a final ."
PHIL005,0.43," The professor made the class much harder than need be . Attendance is not mandatory but showing up to lecture is incredibly worth it . The professor is a wonderful, sweet man and is definitely one of my favorite professors on campus ."
PHIL007,0.559, Professor (Coleen) was very poor at using time effectively in class . Course material itself isnt too hard however . Book is somewhat verbose and reading it can be a challenge . Quizzes are 90% of your grade .
PHIL008,0.326, The concepts can be a little hard to grasp but the classwork is fairly low . CS/CE/EE majors easily carry this class while other majors may struggle a bit . About half the class ended with As and the other half got Cs/Ds .
PHIL009,0.898," There's only 2 mandatory essays. 4 if you count the first one, which is a practice essay to get feedback and stuff, while the fourth one replaces your lowest essay score (provided that it was above a 70%) I got an A- but you still have to work for your grade ."
PHIL010,0.957," If you're taking it with Jeremy Pober, expect a pretty easy class . He's a great professor and lectures very clearly so that the material (which can be sometimes challenging) is broken down into simple concepts . The midterm was easy for me and I anticipate the final on being equally simple ."
PHIL030E,0.871," Midterm was not so bad but your grade depends on your TA . Likewise for your essay too since there’s only one . Entire grade is balanced by midterm, essay, and final ."
PHIL030I,0.834," Professor Harmer is a decent professor, but the lectures were dry and boring at times . 4 open-book quizzes ONLINE worth 5pts each (20% of grade), along with 2 essays .

PHIL100,0.655, Taken Winter 2024 with Professor Wood . He just irritates my soul but a lot of people like him so maybe it's just me . The course is kinda easy if you actually read but even if you don;t as long as you have a general idea you will pass .
PHIL101,0.382," If you are a philosophy major, take this course as early as possible . The skills learned from Dr. Macnamara are invaluable . You'll feel capable"
PHIL113,0.916," No homework or exams, you only have to write two essays the entire course . The hardest thing is coming up with new contributions so you can't just write a compare and contrast essay on two of the readings ."
PHIL124,0.197," This class is really easy if you took PHIL008 (Intro to Logic, maybe that's 8 I don't remember which one it is) I think only Michael Nelson teaches it . The real pain in the butt is that if you fail any one of his three exams, you fail the class . The other reviews of this class still apply ."
PHIL151,0.93," As a computer science major, I found this class pretty interesting due to the professor . She grades pretty leniently, considering the fact I haven't written an essay in 4 years, but still walked away with a B+. Attendance mandatory (10%)"

PHYS02LA,0.016," The lab manual has grammar and procedural mistakes and throws a bunch of information at you at once . The lab notebooks were extremely difficult because they are very concept-based and require you to derive formulas you learn in lecture . Pre-lab assignments were mid, some are easy while others are hard . The final was ok if you had a thorough lab notebook, but still there was no way to prepare for it ."
PHYS002B,0.414, Wimpenny is boring but he has written exams so partial credit is possible Mulligan is a good prof . Mohideen has large curves with the avg being a B. Lots of formulas to memorize but not to difficult if you look at units .
PHYS02LB,0.337, The lab is mixed depending on the grading of the TA and the experiements . Sometimes the experiments is long and other times is short and simple . The LSA at the end really suck where some questions came from out of nowehere that can drag your lab grade down .
PHYS002C,0.473," This was the easiest of the Physics 2 series for me . Content-wise, it has some topics from gen chem, which makes it familiar and a bit easier to understand . Avoid Anderson ."

PHYS006,0.437," This was a super fun class to take if you enjoy science . It was basically an astronomy class including learning about different types of stars, gravity, planets, and things of that sort . Discussion sections are optional to attend, but found them very helpful ."
PHYS007,-0.184, This class focuses on cosmology and overviews the main contributors and topics in physics . There is little to no math at all since learning was more conceptual .
PHYS008,0.528," This class is a good mix of memorization and conceptual math . It can be difficult for some people who struggle with memorization or math . Attend lectures, practice on MasteringPhysics and do the practice midterms/finals ."
PHYS018,0.761, Class has a lot of math problems so make sure to study with the homework . Homework is optional but weekly quizzes during discussions . Prof. Brian Siana is so nice and inspiring .
PHYS020,0.348," No math to do or formulas to memorize in this class, you just need to remember vocab and concepts . Quizzes each week at the discussion session, it's only 2 questions . Only reason you should get a bad score in the exams is if you don't know how to navigate through your notes or the textbook ."
PHYS037,0.284, Prof. Mobasher curved the course almost a whole letter grade after the final . The class was all theory of the Big Bang and the events after it . Homework is easy since you can just google it but the material is hard to understand .
PHYS039,0.85," Attendance was mandatory but if you know the PollEverywhere code, you could just mark yourself as present so most people skipped class . Overall a cool class, least workload ever . Prof Seto is a nice guy but I think he's retiring soon so I'm not sure who will take over the class ."
PHYS040A,0.342, This class the exactly equivalent to AP Physics 1(but they don't give credit for some reason) Pay attention during rotation . Read the textbook thoroughly and watch a ton of Khan Academy videos or else you'll do really bad in the class . Prof. Khulman is a really good professor .
PHYS040B,0.421," If you suffered through 40A, you will definitely suffer through 40B . The class is pretty reasonable and doable and the midterm isn't that bad . The final was nothing like any of the practice or homework ."
PHYS040C,0.297," Prof George Becker was a breath of fresh air, the lectures and demonstrations were interesting, the labs are easier than A and B imo . If you score higher on your final than the midterm, the final replaces your midterm ."
PHYS041A,0.619," Professor Seto is an excellent teacher who will provide encouragement and insight . Homework and reading is every day with labs and quizzes every week . Prof Westerdale doesn't really lecture, just does proofs on the board and expects you to understand what he's doing . Python/coding is also taught concurrently by Alex ."
PHYS041B,0.598," This class is all self taught; professor Harry Tom rarely lectures . The homework, quizzes, and labs alone are worth 50% of the grade . A passing grade (C-) is 40% which means you can get a high C even if you get a 0 on the final ."
PHYS041C,0.166, The textbook is exceedingly complicated and the homework problems are often never going to show on quizzes or the final . The math gets so complicated you will need to use Mathematica so you can get homework points .
PHYS111,-0.251," Hamann isn't a straightforward professor- he'll assume you know some stuff about astronomy and will carry on through the lecture . His lectures are very poor: doesn't do example problems, assumes you know the astronomy stuff, and barely goes over the material in class . He doesn't understand that many people in the class aren't concentrated in astro ."
PHYS130A,0.438," Phys130A is classical mechanics, conceptually the class is straight forward but mathematically it can pose a challenge . Prof. Gary is a very good professor.

PHYS130B,0.512," Peng Wei is an excellent teacher. Teaches the topics very well! If you get all A's on homework assignments and at least an 80% on the midterm, you're set for an A in the class . Final exam were 2/3 star problems so expect a difficult exam ."

POSC005W,0.4, Prof. William (Parkes) Riley's lectures were an absolute drag and nobody went to them . His powerpoints would just be huge paragraphs he'd read off of....which he'd later upload on iLearn. Only bothered to show up because he randomly takes attendance and you get points for that .

POSC015,0.581," There were a lot of readings, like way too much, but if you go over the book and lecture slides, it's a breeze . Dr. Indridason or Indridi is a nice man, at least to me, but dosen't keep the class lively enough for most people to come . Irepoglu-Carreras is the best! If you can choose, take it with her ."
POSC017,0.782," Professor Dionne taught this course - super easy, exams are given ahead of time and essay questions are drawn out of a hat . If you put in some effort and actually study, getting an A is easy . Lectures are pretty boring and the reading is overwhelming ."
POSC020,0.415," If you take this class with Prof. Marissa Brookes, it's fairly easy as long as you just show up to lectures and discussion . Paul D'Anieri is extremely helpful in office hours, intelligent, kind, and has damn good music taste . Irepoglu-Carreras is the best professor!"

PSYC128,-0.846," Even though he apparently was nice during previous quarters, he suddenly got pretty unaccommodating during Fall 2020 when I took this class .

PSYC150,-0.813," For the quarter I took Personality I had Dulce Wilkinson as the instructor, and while most of the course content was mostly easy, she was the most unaccommodating instructor I’ve ever had .

PSYC152,0.787," There were 3 midterms in the class (3rd midterm is the ""final"" exam), but you 1 midterms score is dropped . The final covers all 60+ disorders and there will be multiple case studies on it so don't forget them ."

PSYC182E,0.156, i took it with Dr. Cecelia Cheung and basically the only “required” work was an in-class worksheet that we could work on together every week and a final project that was really minimal . As a psych major I can confidently say it's by far the easiest psych class I’ve ever take .
PSYC182N,0.468," Research paper and final presenation, worked in groups over summer, 5 week course. pretty easy with cecelia"
PSYC189,0.225, This was a Psychology and AI course taught by Professor Ian Ballard . Dr. Rosenbaum made the class easy but the material itself was complicated . Interesting class but you need to go to lecture if you want an A .
RLST001,0.902," Professor Alexander is not necessarily a bad professor . Midterm and final exam are the same format and aren't really difficult . The one downside, and it's huge, is that the class was at the Theater and it was at 7:40 in the morning ."

RLST006,0.959," The online class is set up in a specific way where you're broken up into groups and are given questions that correlate with your group number to which you answer during lectures . There was one midterm and one final, both of which Prof. Chang gave out study guides to ."

RLST012H,0.474," As an honors student this class was required W20 for first-years and it was insufferable . Had weekly discussion questions, quizzes after movies we watched in class, take home midterm that took a while to finish, a final paper that was 6-8 pages long, and a final . Overall the grading is pretty easy but she makes it seem like you're going to fail the class ."

SOC183H,0.421," The actual professor, Chioun Lee, was great. Her lectures were good and informative and on Zoom, and the exams were easy . The only issue was the grader for our essays, Juha Lee . This TA was one of the worst TAs ."

SPN004,0.361," If you are a Spanish speaker this is the easiest class basically GPA booster . Heavy reliance on online textbook for homework, quizzes, and final . Professor Navarro is a strict professor during lecture, and grades harshly ."
SPN109A,0.666," Professor Vargas very strict with native speakers, but prepares you well especially if desiring a major/minor in Spanish . Easy grader, mostly grades on grammar/accents ."
SPN109B,0.115," Class is hella easy compared to 109A. Taken with Mirta Copa Vargas and even though the class was hella on her head for being hard, she was not . Her essay topics can be confusing but asking others in the class is key to understanding what to write about ."
STAT004,0.153," The discussions were ok, but  the class was incredibly boring, talking a lot about different variables wasn't my issue . A lot of students were salty they got caught for cheating but if you do your work, it's not that bad ."
STAT008,0.672," The hardest part of this class was the amount of work, and even that isn't too terrible . Lab and Discussion is also very easy . Only downside is 8am lecture ."

STAT100B,0.36," The OpenIntro textbook isn't super helpful, I'd recommend looking up YouTube videos to teach yourself . Dr. Yingzhou Fu (aka Joyce) is to be avoided if at all possible . Midterms weren't too bad, so long as you did the homework ."
STAT107,0.0, Even though it was my first formal programming course the lessons and homework work completely doable . Homework made up a majority of the grade . Discussion assignments were typically smaller scale versions of homework .
STAT110,0.484," Took with professor Zhe Fei and wasn't the best experience . Lectures were him just zooming through slides, class examples hardly helped with hw . Overall class could've been much better if more time was taken to cover each topic with more examples similar to hw."
STAT130,0.155," The contents are ridiculously easy, but that doesn't mean an easy A at all because: Prof Ghosh just makes everything difficult by always changing his idea . The homework doesn't align with his teachings sometimes and it makes it much more difficult to do - on top of that they mark off the tiniest mistakes so you lose points easier ."
STAT140,0.776, The hw is similar to the slides shown in class . Main issue is the speed of the class . However as long as you do the hw you'll be fine .
STAT146,0.501," Time Series, for me it was taught by Xinping Cui - She had amazing notes available, and she taught the material well . Homework was given weekly and it was pretty easy as long as you refer back to the lecture slides ."

STAT157,0.167, SAS is probably the easiest language you will learn as a STAT major . The assignments were kinda long but nothing was too difficult as long as you followed along with the lectures and labs . Copying and pasting from previous assignments is highly encouraged .

STAT160B,0.136," Probably one of the hardest classes in stats major . Taught by Shemra Rizzo . Homework was optional, but you better do it ."
STAT160C,0.133," There was no curve for this class . You will question why you are majoring in this field . Just like 160 A and B, there's at least a whole letter grade curve ."
STAT167,0.931, The class itself isn't too bad there is a lot to constantly be doing when taking the class though . If you aren't working on Hw you'll be doing a lab assignment . The lectures can get pretty dense but thankfully professor gives a 5 minute break . Poll everywhere questions are asked but they help you rather than hurt you .
STAT169,0.41, Her slides aren't the most helpful and she tends to go by pretty fast in class . She didn't show almost at all how to do or think of doing problems via R instead delegated that to the TA .

STAT183,0.627," The professor is teaching how to present, and she's a horrible presenter with stuttering . She doesn't really come prepared to the class . This class grading wise isn't too hard ."
TFDP010,0.886," There is no h.w. for this class . The final is super easy (it's a 3-5 min group performance, you get full points for participation). This class with Buklin was pretty easy ."
TFDP021,0.88, Some assignments and work were done last minute and it felt very haphazard . Prof. Floresislas is an amazing lady but unfortunately the syllabus was changed so much that we ended up completely throwing it away by week 5 .

VNM003,-0.873," If possible, AVOID taking Vietnamese if she is still the only instructor . Co Kim is old, outdated, and unfair in many ways . She yells at students during lecture (on Zoom), and accuses all of them of being unmindful . She expects you to be above and beyond in Vietnamese, meanwhile her English is not on par ."
