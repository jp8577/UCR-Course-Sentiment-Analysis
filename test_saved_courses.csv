AHS008,2.5,"LeBlanc is a good prof and entertaining, gives 2 midterms and one final and an essay and make sure you do well on those if you want a good grade. Her exams are heavily memorization based so get ready to memorize 10+ images per week with the dates, medium, artist, culture, etc. Overall the class is difficult but not impossible if you put in work.",6.0,2/7/2020
,2.5,"Taking this class online is difficult because Professor Le Blanc spends about half an hour talking about the Dodgers or politics before finally settling into the lecture. She also rambles a bit so you have to really pay attention or ask specific questions. The material isn't really difficult to understand, it's just that whatever she says in lecture is so niche that you have to be present. Our midterm was assigned over three days, and it was THREE five page essays regarding images on slides that gave no further information than who painted it in what year. And on top of that two weeks later we have another five page essay due that isn't even a final.",7.0,11/16/2020
,2.5,"Had it with LeBlanc. The class is based off slides and extra readings that can be from 10-20 pages long. Discussions are based off the readings but you can sometimes just skim through the reading and you'll be fine. You need to sign up on a website to get your participation grade which is only 3 lectures but you don't actually have to participate. Lecture isn't mandatory only the 3 days you sign up. There are 1-2 paragraph unit responses which weren't even that bad and are due every 2 or 3 weeks I believe. 1 midterm, 1 paper and a final. Midterm consists of 3 questions 5 pages in length and she only gives you about a week to complete. Final is the same format. If you don't like writing, then I wouldn't recommend this class.",6.0,3/8/2021
